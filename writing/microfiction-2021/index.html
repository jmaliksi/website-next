Here’s the January haul.</p><p>Clouds rumbled across the sky, chasing the third sun down the horizon and threatening a dark, wet evening. Tel hated nights like these. She’d need to find shelter deeper in the forests where neither rain nor moonslight pierced the canopy, but where less pleasant company slept.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>You open your eyes, greeted by the morning sun casting a cool sliver of light across your face. Blankets melt around you, them as much a part of you as you, them. </p><p>It’s comfortable. </p><p>It’s a dream.</p><p>You’d prefer the ‘scape to stay like this but you have other dreams to attend to.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Ixthian hot sauce. Only fermentable at Lagrange 2 or 3 at Oria V using berries from Jemin’s terminator.”</p><p>“Hot sauce? That’s the grand plan?”</p><p>“Also illegal everywhere outside the Orion arm. Humans love this stuff. You know how your kind is.”</p><p>“You son of a bitch, I’m in.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Wise Aevra put her bright daughter, Aon, in the northern sky to guide us. The Brothers Aui took it on themselves to dance along the east and west to herald dawn and dusk. But the southern sky? There are only stories of when it shined, before Avya, the Darkness, began to feast.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Fas clenched his abs and jerked the stick hard left, feeling the Gs threaten a blackout as a flurry of phaser fire threatened everything, but instead of pulling straight, he cut thrust and let the inertia fly, swinging 180 before engaging stabilizers. Target acquired.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Stance two steps too wide, off-hand directionless, swordspoint a novice’s reckoning of correct. With that guard, Artke was likely to start with a thrust. Lukke dropped to a loose quarta. Should be easy enough to leave Artke with enough fingers to eat but not enough to duel again.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Kirikree let out a low whistle and a double click. The response was a moment of silence, but only just. As Kirikree floated forwarded, jellies and anemones slowly awoke in soft blues and golds, a welcome answer for the prodigal son.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Gwin whooped as they crested a snow-dusted dune and, in response, felt a warmth over the telepathic bond with Tno as the ilvethi beat its four quicksilver wings. No, not “the” ilvethi. *Her* ilvethi. The next years of training would be long and hard, but for now? She grinned.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Dropping in 3, 2, 1—“ Leruch felt his stomach jump as the Raines Octavia flipped from slipspace to main. 30 years in and he’d gotten mostly numb to the dimensional flicker, unlike some of his newer crew. Never did get over those moments seeing the inside of his eyeballs, though.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Liquid rock coalesces into an obsidian boat atop the magma of Hell. Charon’s Carriage, you think sarcastically. But unlike a psychopomp delivering final rest, you have different business to deliver: an ass kicking the Old Ones have not seen since the Big Bang threw them out.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Found in the Maliwanag tropical forests, Arcus Magni is a flowering tree that over its thousands year life will collapse to form living arches that root at both ends. The arches form a dense enough network to create a new ecosystem between forest floor and canopy. </p><p>—Dr. Katiyakan</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>I took off my glasses and rubbed my temples in exasperation. Across my desk was a new client, Paul. 19, nervous, not good at fine print. Between us, a Contract. “Let me get this straight: You summoned Bzelcha, a lowly first layer imp, and traded half your soul for a Lego set?”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Two men walked the dunes, naked yet seemingly unconcerned by the beating sun above and burning sand below. </p><p>The tall one perked up. “Do you feel that?” </p><p>The other simply nodded. “Suppose it’s time, then.” </p><p>As a breeze licked their skin, they both scattered into dust. North.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>In this grim twilight, Shen could see shadows flitting at the edges of his vision among the old neon signs and dust-covered windows—the city’s own memories of Before, made manifest when she started to Dream.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>We laugh and sing a song as we shut down electronics to enter the wormhole. They say keeping spirits high wards off Those Beyond, and like our ancestors on ancient highways, we convince ourselves that ritual—prayer, sobriety, seatbelt—can tilt a 1 in 100000 fate in our favor.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Cool air on the lips <br/>Green grass under foot <br/>A lover’s warm touch <br/>In a valley called home </p><p><br/>What home, what home? <br/>That valley called home <br/>Here’s to old memories <br/>Of that valley called home— </p><p>XC12 didn’t understand the words, but they timed exhaust cooldown well. Just keep digging.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Hello humans, what brings you here?” A baleful greeting sang in our heads. Outside, a glowing mass of gestalt conscious matched our orbit. </p><p>I typed up a response and set the metronome. Aeldrel used thought to communicate, not sound, so we’d need to all speak as one to respond.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Really? Elevator bossa nova?” It was Rad’s first deep space sleep. The psycryochamber hissed shut. “Why not something more fun?” </p><p>“Your mind needs to be blank to enter the Dreaming,” the AI said, emotionless. “Any deviation may result in mind wipe.” </p><p>“Wait wh—“ Rad fell asleep.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Io sings a staccato melody and Ganymede a soft tenor hum. Saturn and his many moons ring a complex tone as the other giants play their throaty bass. Sol has enjoyed the choir’s harmony for 4 billion years, but something recently has been off tune with the third world.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The ship’s psychic had a habit of singing when she woke up, and like a rooster crowing straight into everyone’s minds, it made for one helluva alarm clock. The captain, early bird that she was, seemed to actually enjoy it. Jetz didn’t pretend to understand the aviarians.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Over the past month, Tala had grown used to Raul’s little hum during reentries, and even had even taken to humming along the past couple drops. It reminded her of her grandmother in the kitchen, and just like with Nanay, when they hit the high note, the heat should’ve gone off.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Yuzu flipped on comms at the usual time. Far from the red shine of Anatres, her ship charged enough to keep the antenna up for about an hour each “day”—long enough to ping out another distress signal, and also long enough to catch the big band sections of Old Earth’s I Love Lucy.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Despite homeworlds in different arms, Humans and torvok somehow shared the same taste in post-occlusion drunken singing. The imprecise meters were so discordant to En, but that was fine. It simply turned off its audio processor and raised a glass of ember to join the merriment.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The girl by the campfire drew a bow across her curious instrument with its fingerboard spaced for her long webbed fingers and its body resonating against vestigial wings.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Systems online. Greetings, Jackdaws.” </p><p>“Charlie boy, you ready for this?” Hess asked. </p><p>“When have I not been?” </p><p>The crew laughed, their synchronized mirth flitting through Charles’ analytical engine. As each jumped through the barrier, the crowd roared. Show time.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The earth rumbled, softly at first, but soon crescendoing into an explosion as a tagagiik’s churning maw burst from the canopy, flinging stone, wood, and lightning into the air. Ewa and Marko turned to each other and grinned. Spears in hand, the twins took off toward the beast.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Drip. Drip. Drip. Drip. Day 3 looking for that fucking psionic fluid leak, each fucking splatter in the station’s stupid maintenance vacuums still echoing in everyone’s god damned mind.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Jac flipped Bubblegum Haze off a wall in a flashing arc above the arena, both to get over Calypso Anarchy’s giant swing and to give the crowd a show of fluorescent lightning—and before landing behind the other mech, Jac made sure to give the press box a winning smile.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>He tells a joke about a bird, laughing. I laugh, too, even as I already forget the exact words he used. The words don’t matter. The mindscape is an ever shifting flow of scenes and emotions, and all that matters is us sharing another moment in this alien place.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Patriarch Gyloen strode into the hall followed by a sizable entourage, each dressed to remind all that their ancestors forged the empire: brigandine and silk cut high and tight for riding, and the patriarch himself crowned with a towering, three-horned piece of sung wood.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Damien heard the everblowing western wind grow as he climbed the aerie’s tower. The wind roared off the masonry, but soon, Damien found an oddly quiet door that lead to an open landing under a still air charm. He stepped through, and for the first time, looked down on the clouds.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Gemeti, the first hero and she who walks the sky, plucked the child, Ku-Ayu, from the fires of Ubalnu and climbed Bashaa, tallest brother to Ulbanu, to raise the child to her domain. But in her sleep, fitful Ku-Ayu wailed and belched Ulbanu’s molten wrath, shattering the moon.</p><button class="writing-module--expander--YZGjd">collapse</button></div></div><div class="writing-module--writingEntry--2XOjz popCard" id="microfiction-february-2021"><div><div class="writing-module--tagContainer--1uELe"><p class="writing-module--date--3Eiiy">February 28th, 2021</p><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction"> (<!-- -->microfiction<!-- -->) </a><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction-2021"> (<!-- -->microfiction 2021<!-- -->) </a></div><div class="writing-module--title--2MY9Q" role="link" tabindex="0"><h1>Microfiction February 2021</h1></div></div><div><p>I decided to tweet out microfiction every day of 2021. Here’s the February haul.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>You pull the chain and hold your breath, the coal dust thrown in the air a choking cloud that irritates your eyes and nose. The timing must be right. You mutter a spell and feel dead trees sing from beyond, infusing their compressed remains with power drawn from an ancient sun.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Haex rises in three days. We strike then, when my magic is strongest.”</p><p>“But their magic will be just as strong then!”</p><p>“That’s why we’re bringing you.” Ri crossed her arms, smug. </p><p>Flots paused. “Go on?” </p><p>“Ever see a wizard finish an incantation while being punched in the face?”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A group of wizards strode into my village, one hefting a carved box that amplified the thumps and beats of intersecting leylines. The one in front called for Ukias. The last I saw was the two doing flips and spins in time with the beat to channel fire and lightning at each other.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A flash of movement, then pain. In your adrenaline-addled dying breaths, you realize that there was a point in the thicket when hunter became hunted, but you can’t figure out when. All you can think is how embarrassing this memory will be for whatever iteration of you gets out.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>I dropped a portion of bread and salt by the campfire. A pair of sarãpong, curious creatures as they were, crept forward to snatch the bread then joined me in my evening meal. Their movement was like spider made of black oil. Uncanny. Yet in a way, I found them charming.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Gemstones are chosen and faceted to to pay for the right spell from the right fey. Ruby to call a servant of Hastom, sapphire for Moso, diamond for Ozzem. A single incorrect angle is the difference between Bhamas bringing rain for your crops or drowning you on your 38th birthday.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Jef suddenly found themselves extremely tired and extraordinarily hungry and uncomfortably wet, which probably meant stasis just went offline. Hopefully this time it was on purpose and this junker of a ship was actually close to the next planet this time.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Damn, they were right about the phantom fart smell. Everything’s sealed, but it’s hard to forget the atmosphere is methane.” </p><p>“You sure you didn’t toot in your suit?” </p><p>“What are you, 12?” </p><p>“Yeah, got my PhD from Rockridge Elementary. Prestigious as fuck.” </p><p>“Whatever. Let’s go.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Go ahead, sweetie.” </p><p>Ione took in what breath his young lungs could hold then blew it out over a painted clay figure. As the breath came to an end, the figure shuddered, unfurled its wings, then took flight. </p><p>Tava smiled. Ione was talented. He would make a fine god some day.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Why do liches love traps anyway?” Cetano asked, tossing a pebble at the obvious pressure plate. </p><p>Lilith took a half step to the right and shrugged, a rusted axe swinging past her. “Makes ‘em horny, probably.” </p><p>“They’re already ha—” </p><p>“I’m pushing you into the next one.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“I’m pretty sure this series of sigils is for binding—“ </p><p>“Pretty sure? Don’t you have a degree?” </p><p>“In sewage alchemy!” </p><p>“Just shut up and fix my arm already.” </p><p>“There’s a 50/50 chance this’ll knit the bone or extract all the magnesium from your body. Please don’t rush me.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Maldonado pulled his furs tighter and cursed the Arctic Circle for the twelfth time today. Currents had brought the Eden far north as the governor had decided fuel was better spent keeping the arcology water hot rather than running the engines on a mile long island of steel.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>One moment, the crystal forest was a jagged, brooding darkness; the next, it was a dazzling display of faceted light as the sun rose above the mountains. With morning come, the forest erupted in long whistles and croons, each call resonating among the amethyst leaves.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The old storyteller began with a throaty hum and a slow pluck on her bow. </p><p>“Gather before me, hear my tale: </p><p>In those ancient days, </p><p>When Aten gave us the stars, </p><p>When Ushar showed us first wheat, </p><p>When Yastet taught us of flame. </p><p>Know of Great Queen Re, who stole writing from God.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A Singer’s worth was not in thunder and lightning—any child could smash two fronts together to ruin a town’s day. No, their worth was in the wind: fast enough to fill a sail, elegant enough to avoid rain. Kenna knew her worth. To any that forgot, well, the storm was still there.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>One would be forgiven for being wary of ethereal flame in the bog, and one would be understood for calling those who followed fools, but for they who heeded the faerie song, the promises of adventure and fortune always came true; just not in our mortal sense.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A pod of cairisdan whales breached near the horizon, yet in the darkness the eyes along their massive bodies sparkled like stars in the restless ocean, and their baleful mindsong washed over the Aurore as if under the waves. An ill omen. There would be fitful sleep tonight.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Had it survived until today, the Bronze Spire would have been a true wonder of the modern world with its spiraling library that touched the clouds. Alas, while infused bronze seems invincible, it is not immune to a dedicated formula to bind tin, and soft copper does not last.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>You would not believe what umbral horrors come from the depths, for I did not either. My father and my father’s father knew peace, as I’m sure did yours, But know this: the heavens will align, and they will come. Heed this warning. </p><p>— Tablet I, recovered from the ruins of Naram-Si</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“We’re in.” </p><p>“Was getting a bit worried, love.” </p><p>“Have I ever let you down?” </p><p>“Istanbul, 22—“ </p><p>“Anyway, Dimes, I’ve updated your map with cameras and drones. Pick me up something nice, yeah?” </p><p>“Always do. Ta for now.” Diamond entered the corporate slip dimension. Easy money.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>I place my hand on the rook and feel the familiar sensation of my infinite eyes opening. Most simply see a different pattern of waves, a new cry from a new gull. In twelve the tides recede. A beachside love gone wrong and right. </p><p>Rook to G6. The world turns.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The problem with Cadrani bread was that their wheat-analogue formed a transparent crust, meaning Shel could see the unnervingly even crumb; it was like a nest of eyes in a disarmingly inert loaf. Ready. Waiting. Delicious, but at what cost?</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The Loroxolan entourage was imposing to be sure: four squat legs supporting a thick frame, and the shortest still twice the height of the ambassador. They wore helmets to breathe, though their visors were marked for individualism: family sigils, jagged geometries, scenes of home.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Would that it be so simple as to forget the sweet memory of light touch and lingering scent, the impassioned taste on the lip… yet when [] asks for a Name, you find yourself unable to give it. Would that you could oblige, but [] does not accept a lie, no matter how believed.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The grey city sprawled below them as the Beanna descended, its faceted towers of concrete and glass once a beacon of modernity, now a forlorn shell of a forgotten boom—a world so far out that only mined æther was not worth visiting when hyperspace was no longer reliable.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Pâl’s cape shifted as it Walked, each new fold holding a dizzying glimpse of another world for a single moment before flapping to the next. Brilliant stars, lush forests, empty deserts, alien hearths and homes.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Uh—“ </p><p>“Uh? That’s all you have to say after murdering me? Can you at least tell me why? I had so much left to do!” </p><p>“Old prophecy…” </p><p>“What the fuck.”</p><p>“Look, I didn’t know you’d come back… Anyway, guess I’ll be—“ </p><p>“Oh hell no, I’m haunting your ass until I get sent to hell.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“I envy you, lieutenant.” The captain leaned on the gunwhale, peering over the dark sea. “Every sailor has a defining day.”</p><p>“We faired well today.”</p><p>“Yours wasn’t today, lass.” The captain chuckled. “Worse things than pirates out there. Eyes up. Heaven is deeper than the abyss.”</p><button class="writing-module--expander--YZGjd">collapse</button></div></div><div class="writing-module--writingEntry--2XOjz popCard" id="microfiction-march-2021"><div><div class="writing-module--tagContainer--1uELe"><p class="writing-module--date--3Eiiy">March 31st, 2021</p><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction"> (<!-- -->microfiction<!-- -->) </a><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction-2021"> (<!-- -->microfiction 2021<!-- -->) </a></div><div class="writing-module--title--2MY9Q" role="link" tabindex="0"><h1>Microfiction March 2021</h1></div></div><div><p>I decided to tweet out microfiction every day of 2021. Here’s the March haul.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The first sign is the unseasonably beautiful weather, the second a haunting melody so pristine it feels like a dream. The sound rings clearer at the approach: the repeated glory of HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH ad infinatum as angels descend, mouths wide in song yet unable to scream.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Toshan gently plucked a leaf from his garnet succulent, its reflective, faceted surface at odds with the plump flesh between his thumb and forefinger. He transferred it to a runed alembic and almost as soon as the vessel closed, red ether began to drip into a waiting inkwell.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Chameleon suits were all the rage in Slide City, not to blend in, but to strut apart from the crowd. The streets were a shifting throng of mesmerizing colors as lurid as the billboards in the sky. Yet for those of us who did want to disappear, well, it was easier than ever.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>An entire city-that-should-not-be erupting from the ocean was accompanied by surprisingly little fanfare. With the aliens, time travelers, interdimensional intersection, and so on, the old gods demanding a cult just seemed so passé.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>This was his favorite moment: that last step over the threshold where the Storm gave way to the Edge, the moment you went from sand stinging your eyes to having the clearest view of the stars below your feet.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Adon leaned against Harvel. There was never silence on the Galileo, and the helmets always made things awkward… but it was hard to not be romantic with a rising Io sparkling a new plume overhead and the constant aurora and swirling clouds below.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Line 1 advance! Aim! Fire!” </p><p>The rattling snare was overtaken by the patter of twenty guns aimed at keeping the enemy caster from calling lightning while the main lines fought. </p><p>“Line 3 load! Line 2 advance!” </p><p>They only had a hundred men, but the volley had to be constant.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A crow calls midnight.<br/>The far moon sparkles orange.<br/>Omens, good and bad.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Tamachag let out a low whistle punctuated with a high yip then waited. Moments later, Cota crested a far hill, her rusted wings flapping once for altitude and her talons clutched tight around a fat hare. She was an old ornial, but she still glinted in Tamachag’s eyes.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“If it stretches across the entire cylinder does it really count as ‘the tallest building on Eden’?”</p><p>“The most advanced metamaterial construction project post-launch and your first question is semantics?” </p><p>“I mean it’s more of a pillar than a building, right?” </p><p>“Mark.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>There is exactly 16 minutes deep rumbling that you can feel rather than hear before the siyara begins to move, taking the city on its back with it. This usually gives everyone adequate time to tie down their homes and holdings, but tonight you have been caught drunk in a diner.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Keerati ran in the only direction she could: away from the gnashing of a thousand teeth and down an unfortunately clear path. Clean forest floors meant the grinlek had swarmed through here already. Hopefully they had passed days ago and it was only the swarm behind her left.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The Writhing Fields were the exact kind of nightmare that Hastios was expecting and dreading. The ground was covered in tangled, sickly vines, necrotic magic ironically the only thing keeping them alive—and aggressive.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>When the first cube on Ganymede was found, the world simultaneously debated and held its breath for the next couple decades until Galapagos could land with investigative instruments for intelligent life. Historians often mark this as the clear inflection point before the End.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Nidinta applied another layer of dragons blood to her horse’s carapace, polishing it to perfect silver sheen and clean enough to see the greens and blues of the Bridge in the reflection. One day she would make it up there. Perhaps not today, but one day.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Always seemed a shame that in order to hop to the next timeline, one had to destroy something in the current one. Hopefully this was the last one. Charlie sighed and muttered a spell, amethyst flame consuming the 221 pounds of gold before him, then vanished himself.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Beware the trap of tyrants and cowards: so easy to sacrifice a kingdom yet so difficult to give up a home. Only a fool or a child would find comfort or refuge in such simplistic thinking. </p><p>—from the letters of Empress Dowager Suha to Prince Dalandan of Atis</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Remember to hydrate!” it said, another tick of temptation added to the pile. Of course, an offhand verbalized desire for quiet is how Hetiqe found himself parched in the desert in the first place. Wouldn’t be giving the demon the satisfaction again.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>And so they swim, forever circle, <br/>Beneath the black in blue. <br/>Such teeth that gnash, though ever hungry, <br/>Find little more to chew.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The Duchess steepled her hands, contemplating the aged tome before her. She smiled. The kings could play at their wars, thinking a thousand lives for a dynasty dramatic and worthy of song, when in reality, a few strokes on old parchment would bring it all down with only one head.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>It felt like every bill to stay connected to the Cortex was higher than the last, and the work to be found within was less fulfilling each time. Maybe it was time to become a psi-farmer.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The crew was in place, each soul in the theoretically correct spot around the m-drive to draw the correct flow of energy around the approaching leyline. 10, 9, 8. Aviels checked her math one more time. 5, 4. Everything seemed in order… wait was Ensign Zaloir—</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>So does she sleep, the dreamer of all, <br/>The goddess who gives us the night. <br/>Play in the garden, do your duties above, <br/>Make deals with her phantoms and wights. <br/>But be quick and be quiet lest her rest wane too early, <br/>And call morning to burn all in her light.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Of course prior attempts to transfer a mind from one body to the next; the transfers all focused on the 4 dimensional extrusion of a 7D object. This was it. These were the equations needed to define the boundaries of consciousness and govern its movement. Immortality at last.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The frozen winds bit what parts of Sælmar’s face that could not be covered with layers of cloth and fur; ifhe didn’t find the Underground soon, his servos would be frozen shut. Trying to convince a bunch of humans to let in a synth was hard enough even with a working jaw.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Like all the others in Matiek, they wore a sash patterned to their station, and the sigils indicated the couple was of a First Family. However, their house colors were blue and gold. The archon would be sashed in purple, but Sho could not tell which of them was wearing it.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The 1942th floor of Arcology Rho was a multi-story atrium purpose-built to watch cumulonumimbus clouds roll under and around you from behind the safety of quantum glass. The danger of lightning and sound of thunder were all academic concerns to the citizens who were born here.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Much like DNA, something of the mind was lost on every copy, each dream some final metaphysical outburst as memories shunted from one side of REM to the other. This was fine until now. The brain died after a century or two, but the soul never evolved to defend against millennia.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>When a teleportation spell big enough to disappear the big boat was found, the world laughed, cried, and cheered. About 1000 years later, humanity would learn the spell had been temporal-sympathetic, not spatial, as the ship showed up stuck in a hyperspace lane.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The first breath back from cryo wasn’t anything dramatic—due to the sedatives, it was like blinking, except someone different standing over your tube. The second breath, the breath that came with realization, was far worse: waking up meant it was your month on maintenance duty.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>John stepped over the threshold and had to take a moment to collect and reorient himself. Just because he had read about the Corridor didn’t mean his eyes were yet willing to accept the shifting Escheresque geometries connecting every doorway in the multiuniverse.</p><button class="writing-module--expander--YZGjd">collapse</button></div></div><div class="writing-module--writingEntry--2XOjz popCard" id="microfiction-april-2021"><div><div class="writing-module--tagContainer--1uELe"><p class="writing-module--date--3Eiiy">May 1st, 2021</p><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction"> (<!-- -->microfiction<!-- -->) </a><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction-2021"> (<!-- -->microfiction 2021<!-- -->) </a></div><div class="writing-module--title--2MY9Q" role="link" tabindex="0"><h1>Microfiction April 2021</h1></div></div><div><p>I decided to tweet out microfiction every day of 2021. Here’s the April haul.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Even from leagues away, Vimala could see the dead god’s shattered beak and blind eyes as a silhouette on the horizon, taller than the mountains it formed when trying to break out from the world, and she could feel the quintessence fault lines growing beneath the ground.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>As the quartet approached their crescendo, August felt the resonance where his palm met Lady Haleton’s. They locked eyes, the rest of the ballroom consigned to a muted ringing. She felt it, too. </p><p>Mr. Risewell was right. Tonight would make quite a interesting evening indeed.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Landen was vaguely aware that #13 was closing from behind, but ahead there was only sand, the keeper, and the tower. Down by one, a high goal would win it, but the keeper had been a monster in the arc. Landen could practically feel #13’s breath on his back. Now or never.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Mt Estrelya was a barren black spear from earth to heaven, a sudden cry from Mother Earth to push her realm to the sky. Yet when the peak nearly grasped the stars, Mother Sky froze the liquid rock in place. Nothing but ash has swirled the centuries since.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A gestalt of ravens was an impressive thing: a stories high formation of a thousand synchronized wings and an orchestra of caws modulated to form human speech in aggregate. Today they came to negotiate ownership of a particularly shiny skyscraper.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Her hair was touched by Fire, each lock a lick of flame glimpsed from Meravath’s domain and frozen into sun bright halos wreathing burned out eyes.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The towers of Geval could be seen from leagues away, a testament to not just surviving the flood, but prospering. In the thousand years since the world sank beneath Orovan’s waves, countless kingdoms rose and fell, but only one stayed afloat throughout.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“A whole wheel?” </p><p>“Specifically from a Fyrdoen cow and aged 12 years.” </p><p>“I, uh, have a 12 year from Gyloen.” </p><p>“No no, the conjunction wasn’t even remotely affecting that area. Do they not teach cheesemongers star charts anymore? I swear…” </p><p>“M’lord I just work here.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Above a barren valley, <br/>Alight a lake of glass, <br/>A black swan sings beleagured, <br/>Beneath the black moon’s maw. </p><p>Among the spirits milling, <br/>Aloft aetheric cries, <br/>A demon wakes with eyes of diamond, <br/>Beset to bind the world.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>A crown for a queen but a king for the crown, <br/>A battle now won by his ghost. <br/>The memory of laughter and the memory of pain, <br/>Gone memories she cherished the most.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Otto could hear the ajanprata well before anyone from the village saw their spindly silver lines over the horizon. They came and went in a day, their deliberate pinprick steps somehow not disturbing the livestock with any tremors but unfortunately ruining the neighbor’s barley.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Elidyr almost preferred traversing the caverns without any light. The crystals were for him and the other elves and humans; the dwarves with their blind white eyes had an unerring sense of depth and knew every crack and crevice as soon as their tendrilous beards touched them.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Çive plucked her thread from the air, a cool tingle spreading from where her finger tips briefly reached Between. Over 3, under 1, over 3, under 2. In theory, this pattern would bring luck, but if nothing else, it would look nice.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>You awaken face down in sand, damp from salty tides rolling at your feet. As your eyes focus, you’re sure the shipwreck killed you—what at first seemed like a towering cliff is quarried stone forming a castle stretching impossibly in each direction as far as the eye can see.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>In another life, perhaps they could be together, she said; the stars were not aligned in this one. Perhaps, perhaps. She thrusts the dagger into her abdomen and smiles, feeling her conscious slip to the next world while the suns flare their knell.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>In the deepest valley of the world there lies a single spot that the sun has not touched. The only light it gets is every 24 years when the far moon swings near, and only in that week of moonlight do the cobalt roses bloom, their crystalline thorns ringing maddeningly discordant.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The moonshard floating above Cithrel’s head cast an ethereal glow over the arcology. Cithrel looked to Adwae. He was on edge. While humans may have built these places, a thousand years had made them foreign to all—and humans didn’t find small comfort in the moon like the elves.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Empress 279, you are cleared to drop.” </p><p>“Thank the gods. Feels like purgatory is longer and longer each time.” </p><p>“Sorry about that,Two Seven Niner, but you know the rules. Can’t risk another incursion.” </p><p>“Yeah͓͕̯̫̼̜͎̫̓̔͛̎̐̆͒̈̍͟͝.” </p><p>“Empress 279 abort your drop, I repeat abo—“</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>It was the ultimate irony that we’d be thirsty in a rain forest but the rains of this planet were toxic to earthforms, and the engineers hadn’t figured out a good purification method yet—too busy keeping the moisture traps running so we at least had something to ration at all.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>In total there were 138 clocktowers in Dapplesturm, and only 53 used 12-hour faces. The 13 clergy-run towers counted 24 hours written in ecclesiastic script, and the rest used unique systems that their builders thought best—that is, more obtuse than the last clock a rival built.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>With enough synapses, animals gained awareness of self, awareness of the future, awareness of the universe. Surely a million trillion wires could do the same. And yet, with 73.1518% of the world repurposed, the Machine still found itself feeling nothing. Perhaps one more wire.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>As the tail gunner, James had served just as long as Vaughan but never received half the accolades—the riders could control the beasts, and a dragon by your side was always impressive. And yet when other scales appeared on the horizon, it was James that kept them in the air.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“The hell was that?” </p><p>“Egg.” The old bosun was already pulling on a helmet and loading his space gun. </p><p>“… why did it sound so wet.” </p><p>“Lotta tentacles. Good for grabbing ships and spacers. Also good eating. C’mon, let’s go,” the bosun said, shoving a space gun into my chest.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Systems are green, no hostile outside. How ya feeling Tinks?” </p><p>“Already feel covered in sand. Any way we can get these bots sealed better?” </p><p>“Find me some weatherstripping out there and we can talk. Until then—“ the bay door started to open bringing in the harsh wasteland suns.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The boy wiped sweat from his brow and caught his breath as best he could on the unstable footing—the colossus was none the wiser about the boy’s grueling climb to its head glyph. The boy took out his phone and took several selfies then jumped off with his glide suit.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>No one could say when the sky first began to crumble, just to avoid looking where the blues and oranges and blacks had peeled away like weatherworn paints on a forgotten canvas.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Every 894 years, the seven greatest mountain ranges in the world would shake as the titans that had slept under them awoke. From a distance, their gargantuan ritual could almost be described as a dance—beautiful, alien, and forgotten. Few lived to describe a closer point of view.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Calico whipped his phasecycle down the lower streets of Mania, calmly glitching through unperturbed jay walkers busy with their own affairs.

Subtle, but obvious to anyone who had shorn and amended the Veil themselves.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The seers spun the wheel and the entire room became motion as gears and pistons reconfigured themselves. The seers claimed that this let them see the future, as if a machine so complex approximated the universe, but who were we to argue when they were right more often than not.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The Langam colonies were still unsettling to Dina, despite being ambassador for 4 years. Each hivemind communicated by thought and pheromones and silk, and so their towered cities were permeated by gossamer thread, sweet scents, and imagined song—but no sound save scuttling.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Charles had anxiety.

Mendasan is no different.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Outside the terminator is not a story of humanity: we are too fragile for these extremes, and so we must stay where the sun is shallow and the land is red, and where the great rivers travel from dark to light and carve deep valleys wherein we can hide from the scouring winds.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The young man was also dressed in Kemyas green dueling robes and wore a jade mask carved into an eju’s gaping maw. Curiously, his entire face—soft cheeks and softer nose, icy eyes, and a slight frown—was visible as his mask only encircled the sides of his head.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Receiving a sliver of soul felt like being caught in the wind plains and getting hit by a full grown binye tree’s 10ft scale at 100mph, like every bone crushed to fine pulp, like every vein filled with fire. Then it passed and Nivilai was just aware of how sweaty she had gotten.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Historical record indicates that practice of covering one’s facial birthmarks with a mask started around 1500 years ago, and prior art even suggest that such birthmarks were rare before then. It is not lost that the Veil was first breached around this time, as well.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Kadjasi are strong, and though they have a rich history of plow and milk and meat, they have just as rich a history of walking into the rivers laden with goods with no one able to stop them, as well as stubbornly refusing to drive even a few miles from where they were spawned.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The most prominent life above the canyons on the scoured surface are the binye trees: spires that reach from ground to sky for hundreds—sometimes thousands—of yards, covered in black and red airfoil scales that drink the sun and protect the main body from the wind and debris.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The deck was a mess of activity centered around the two dozen or so kadu that would be driving the barge upstream. The lead rider was checking his mount’s yoke, while another keeper was throwing clouds of pulverized grain at some of the kadu waving their feeding gills about.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The gallery was not large, but its four walls all featured windows so broad and so clear that Nivilai thought she’d stepped outside for a moment. She’d only ever seen colored glass in vases and small, distorted panes. </p><p>Of course, Nivilai’s first thought was to touch the window.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>In the late indigo light, the masses of kadjasi were hard to make out as individual silhouettes in the mud. One of the kadjasi shifted aroudn in the pile, getting as far as pulling its first four limbs over another then giving up and lying back down to sleep.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The ravine walls were 3–4 miles high, yet the chasm had been carved so wide by the River Jandu that Nivilai wouldn’t have guessed that they were any taller than the Berenjal valley’s. The river itself could have been mistaken for a lake if not for churning whitewater.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>On the third day, the barge happened to pass a school of salmon making their way upstream. The crew had a specific winch and powder-launched harpoon on deck for reeling in the powerful fish that swam the great river, and they had managed to catch four of the gigantic creatures.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Nivilai’s ceremonial robes split only from neck to navel, and somehow, the Berenjal tailors had fit fifteen steel clasps that, as far as the adept was concerned, required a deep understanding of celestial mechanics to tighten and close.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>“Oh yeah, kadu are incredible—those big wings aren’t for nothing. Same for all those gills. Makes it real easy for them to figure out which way the gusts are going and to get lift without having to flap so furiously like all the bugs and bats we got down here in the ravines.”</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>With easy to traverse water and such high cliffs, the city that formed along the Ryngsinoya thrives along manifold layers of strata, growing denser and denser until finally reaching the Imperial Palace on the nightward edge of the river’s source lake.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>The tall vaulted ceilings and the exterior walls of the imperial temple were made of impossibly large slabs of clear quartz set into an irregular iron lattice, allowing the golden midday sun to filter into the ziggurat.</p><button class="writing-module--expander--YZGjd">collapse</button></div></div><div class="writing-module--writingEntry--2XOjz popCard" id="microfiction-december-2021"><div><div class="writing-module--tagContainer--1uELe"><p class="writing-module--date--3Eiiy">December 31st, 2021</p><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction"> (<!-- -->microfiction<!-- -->) </a><a class="writing-module--tag--1XPWo" href="/writing/microfiction-2021"> (<!-- -->microfiction 2021<!-- -->) </a></div><div class="writing-module--title--2MY9Q" role="link" tabindex="0"><h1>Microfiction December 2021</h1></div></div><div><p>The skeleton had its ribs painted in alternating red and green, and it wore a festive hat. “Merry Christmas!” it shouted at anyone who passed by.

None took credit for their mother’s murder, but surely only the divine could have killed a god.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>First light was signaled by a vibrant droning horn from the monastery on the hill. The long note sounded for several minutes, steady with alternating paired breaths from the two most senior monks.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>While tracking days on the Ark was useful if nothing other than aligning to human sleep needs, the concept of a year lost meaning as soon as Sol was just another star out the windows.

Both crows cawed back and bobbed.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Astronomers counted at least a hundred energy signatures appear around Jupiter, but barely an hour later they were gone.

Sister 23 was always so dramatic but honestly kind of simple.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>Palatera farming was an involved activity to say the least: days of waiting for Eothal and Yadan to align, then in those brief hours of conjunction harvesting as much of the pink blossoming kelp that grew where the water receded.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>When a glassman walked and talked and laughed and smile, save for the crystalline skin they could be seen for any other man or woman—but when they paused to consider something: no breath, no shifts, just a simple blank stare until their thoughts finished.</p><hr class="wp-block-separator"/><p>When entering a new home, bring water, salt, and chimes across the threshold before anything else.

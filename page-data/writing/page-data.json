That didn&#8217;t seem right. Surely, if the world had ended and plants had become aggressive, they would have done to him what they did to the alarm clock. And yet Thomas awoke, hale and healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Happy 174717 Digitization Day!

Relics include anything with decipherable writing and sigils. Do your part to stem the tide, Citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>By morning, the twelve bright candles only eleven flickered orange over all but spent wax. The twelfth, however, was as tall as it was when ensconced and produced a steady amethyst flame. The ritual was complete. üëÅ‚úçÔ∏è</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Stims were 99.9% efficient in restoring one to an energetic, lucid, and biologically healthy state, but didn&#8217;t sort all the memories of the past weeks. New moon‚Äîwhen the Dreamers weren&#8217;t so dangerous‚Äîwas in a few days‚Ä¶ but maybe Phil could just sneak in a little nap right now‚Ä¶</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When the Goddess was killed, the world fractured as her nine daughters sealed their kingdoms for fear, distrust, and anger at each other. None took credit for their mother‚Äôs murder, but surely only the divine could have killed a god.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>First light was signaled by a vibrant droning horn from the monastery on the hill. The long note sounded for several minutes, steady with alternating paired breaths from the two most senior monks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>While tracking days on the Ark was useful if nothing other than aligning to human sleep needs, the concept of a year lost meaning as soon as Sol was just another star out the windows. Still, humans cherish ritual and habit, and so the new year is celebrated every 600 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Even when the bells stopped tolling on time, even when the mooms forgot to shine, the chorus dogs kept calling midnight with yips, barks, and howls.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Iana put her whole body into the brushstroke of pale yellow loosely mixed with vibrant white, painting a streaking zigzag into the midnight sky. Clouds gathered overhead and sympathetic thunder rang distant at first, then crescendoing to a torrential pour.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Only three comets in the sky tonight. Bad omen to have so few guides for the caravan. The navigators insisted it was enough, but words so rarely sit hand in hand with comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With each of Sequoia‚Äôs quaking steps, the desert stone folded from browns to greens. Only hardy shrubs and crawling grass for now, but perhaps in a hundred years, something more.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Oron had one hand on his sword and the other on the telescope. Three others paced the room, eyes trained on the projected image of an asteroid Himing√¶√∞a had assigned for their watch on the eve of the blood moon. Gods be blessed that nothing fell from heaven tonight.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The saltfolk braid their stories and myths and gods and families into their hair and beards, and yet the one who called himself Arnon sat before them with long straight hair, unadorned and unknotted. Not shaven like a slave‚Äîso he had no identity, by choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gren hate going into the forest. Every tree was covered in sap-sucking urchins, and whenever he had to fetch wood, one would inevitably fall on him. At least their spines weren&#8217;t filled with poison.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Aya carefully worked her spear into the dead dragon&#8217;s sides to peel back her rusted scales. It was a delicate balance of force and finesse: didn&#8217;t want to nick any of those fragile polymer veins and waste any of the dragon&#8217;s precious blood before harvesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the edges of sleeping minds the Dreamlords wander untethered from body and soul yet trapped in that collective conscious of every being that can imagine wonders and terrors beyond what their eyes have ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>That was Tivan‚Äôs crow‚Ä¶ it cawed, clearly alarmed, and Blackwing cawed back. He batted his wing against Qara‚Äôs knees a few times before taking off and landing next to his brother crow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúTivan‚Äôs fallen down the well?‚Äù Qara asked. Both crows cawed back and bobbed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Astronomers counted at least a hundred energy signatures appear around Jupiter, but barely an hour later they were gone. The only evidence anything happened was a tight beam message aimed at a single comm satellite with a message: ‚Äúif anyone asks we weren‚Äôt here, don‚Äôt narc‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The 322nd Aspect born in the year of Creation took governance over bring dusk and dawn as something as dramatic as night was already accounted for. Sister 23 was always so dramatic but honestly kind of simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Palatera farming was an involved activity to say the least: days of waiting for Eothal and Yadan to align, then in those brief hours of conjunction harvesting as much of the pink blossoming kelp that grew where the water receded.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When a glassman walked and talked and laughed and smile, save for the crystalline skin they could be seen for any other man or woman‚Äîbut when they paused to consider something: no breath, no shifts, just a simple blank stare until their thoughts finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When entering a new home, bring water, salt, and chimes across the threshold before anything else. Should the chimes ring, salt the floors and water all doors and windows. Repeat as necessary as you enjoy your abode.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The murderer smelled of strawberries and sunsets and fresh cut ruby. It was always surprising how ignorant the humans were to that lingering scent, so dependent on those two little eyes of theirs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Free trade, hyperspace schematics, full archive access&#8230; Ambassador, to be blunt: what&#8217;s the catch?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Catch?

It didn&#8217;t matter, though. The white-masked figure&#8217;s scythe continued its spin through Anathasa&#8217;s chest, severing her dagger from her heart. A body could not heal once a reaper claimed its souls.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Nivilai had even perfected the art of taking a nap while standing‚Äîthe house adepts simply had to stand behind the Patriarch with their heads bowed while all the pomp and circumstance unfolded, and what was the point of having a hooded robe if not to hide one&#8217;s sleeping eyes?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Emperor-elect Gian Kemyas II thanks House Berenjal for their loyalty,&#8221; the messenger said. Nivilai could have sworn it was just Gian Kemyas I last year. &#8220;And of course, for House Berenjal&#8217;s tribute in souls. The emperor-elect will be pleased with these twenty.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The golden sun still hung four fingers above the southwest horizon. How was there so much day left? The Kemyas entourage had arrived while the sun had peaked high in the south, and the ceremony was so long it felt like it had aged Nivilai to her twentieth birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the simplicity and separation from the main palace, nothing marked the reaper annex as unique among all the other Berenjal buildings aside from a simple sigil of a heart pierced by a dagger: the phylactery. Nivilai thought it looked more like a bean being bisected.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It was easy to forget the man&#8217;s heart was pierced almost a century ago, freezing his body in its prime and healing all the scars and ailments that came after. &#8220;The arena. Thirty minutes. Your scythes don&#8217;t grow themselves.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A reaper&#8217;s dueling harness wasn&#8217;t meant to protect from the scythe as honed voidmetal could cut through almost anything with the same force it took to cut through a pound of flesh. They were, however, significantly easier to move in than ceremonial dress.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Meje Viur Kraval, at least according to the mosaic, was a broad man with dark skin and a strong jaw. Most striking about the mosaic were the eyes: they were set with citrine, and while the other mosaics so too had gemstone eyes, Meje Kraval&#8217;s were aflame under the golden gun.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Oummi finished lighting the last crystal and gestured for both adepts to the center of the arena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Salute.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adepts held their respective scythes first to the side in attention, then simultaneously swept their blades behind themselves. They bowed to each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Approach.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Nivilai slapped her blade against Ranja&#8217;s. As blunted metal clanged against blunted metal, Oummi pulled his hand into a fist. The muted grey ghostlight dominating the room flared into cascades of silver, like moonlight reflecting off a lake but with a thousandfold intensity.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Oummi said. &#8220;When two duelists with disparate masses of souls step beyond the Veil, only one vessel comes back. Mortals cannot see what reapers do this side of the Veil besides flickers of ghostlight. So who is to say how honorable the fight was besides the winner?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>All things considered, a scythe is one of the most awkward weapons to use in a normal (for some definition of normal) duel to the death; however, reaping a soul requires not only cutting the soul from its seat, but pulling it into a phylactery lest it dissipate outside the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The world of Mendasan is the second planet orbiting a small orange sun. In the grand scheme of the galaxy, it is not notable‚Äîfor as time goes to billions, most moons become locked to their parent and so too do planets become locked to their star. Mendasan is no different.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Outside the terminator is not a story of humanity: we are too fragile for these extremes, and so we must stay where the sun is shallow and the land is red, and where the great rivers travel from dark to light and carve deep valleys wherein we can hide from the scouring winds.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The young man was also dressed in Kemyas green dueling robes and wore a jade mask carved into an eju&#8217;s gaping maw. Curiously, his entire face‚Äîsoft cheeks and softer nose, icy eyes, and a slight frown‚Äîwas visible as his mask only encircled the sides of his head.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Receiving a sliver of soul felt like being caught in the wind plains and getting hit by a full grown binye tree&#8217;s 10ft scale at 100mph, like every bone crushed to fine pulp, like every vein filled with fire. Then it passed and Nivilai was just aware of how sweaty she had gotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Historical record indicates that practice of covering one&#8217;s facial birthmarks with a mask started around 1500 years ago, and prior art even suggest that such birthmarks were rare before then. It is not lost that the Veil was first breached around this time, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Kadjasi are strong, and though they have a rich history of plow and milk and meat, they have just as rich a history of walking into the rivers laden with goods with no one able to stop them, as well as stubbornly refusing to drive even a few miles from where they were spawned.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The most prominent life above the canyons on the scoured surface are the binye trees: spires that reach from ground to sky for hundreds‚Äîsometimes thousands‚Äîof yards, covered in black and red airfoil scales that drink the sun and protect the main body from the wind and debris.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The deck was a mess of activity centered around the two dozen or so kadu that would be driving the barge upstream. The lead rider was checking his mount&#8217;s yoke, while another keeper was throwing clouds of pulverized grain at some of the kadu waving their feeding gills about.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The gallery was not large, but its four walls all featured windows so broad and so clear that Nivilai thought she&#8217;d stepped outside for a moment. She&#8217;d only ever seen colored glass in vases and small, distorted panes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Nivilai&#8217;s first thought was to touch the window.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the late indigo light, the masses of kadjasi were hard to make out as individual silhouettes in the mud. One of the kadjasi shifted aroudn in the pile, getting as far as pulling its first four limbs over another then giving up and lying back down to sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The ravine walls were 3‚Äì4 miles high, yet the chasm had been carved so wide by the River Jandu that Nivilai wouldn&#8217;t have guessed that they were any taller than the Berenjal valley&#8217;s. The river itself could have been mistaken for a lake if not for churning whitewater.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>On the third day, the barge happened to pass a school of salmon making their way upstream. The crew had a specific winch and powder-launched harpoon on deck for reeling in the powerful fish that swam the great river, and they had managed to catch four of the gigantic creatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Nivilai&#8217;s ceremonial robes split only from neck to navel, and somehow, the Berenjal tailors had fit fifteen steel clasps that, as far as the adept was concerned, required a deep understanding of celestial mechanics to tighten and close.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh yeah, kadu are incredible‚Äîthose big wings aren&#8217;t for nothing. Same for all those gills. Makes it real easy for them to figure out which way the gusts are going and to get lift without having to flap so furiously like all the bugs and bats we got down here in the ravines.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With easy to traverse water and such high cliffs, the city that formed along the Ryngsinoya thrives along manifold layers of strata, growing denser and denser until finally reaching the Imperial Palace on the nightward edge of the river&#8217;s source lake.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The tall vaulted ceilings and the exterior walls of the imperial temple were made of impossibly large slabs of clear quartz set into an irregular iron lattice, allowing the golden midday sun to filter into the ziggurat.</p>\n","date":"November 30th, 2021","tags":[{"name":"microfiction","slug":"microfiction"},{"name":"microfiction 2021","slug":"microfiction-2021"},{"name":"nanowrimo","slug":"nanowrimo"},{"name":"reaper","slug":"reaper"}]},{"title":"Microfiction Spooktober 2021","slug":"microfiction-spooktober-2021","excerpt":"<p>Another jack lit, another soul captured, this time its quiet eternal scream ringing G minor.

Howell tipped his hat back then strode into the phantom section.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The caravan could easily be seen on the horizon: a line of spindle legged ≈°ir√°f√°r carefully picking through the steppe, each carrying on their carapaced backs a pair riders robed in flowing colors that that relished rather than shunned the winds.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The trees had eyes in a very literal sense, each bulbous growth occasionally splitting open so a solitary blue eye could peer at the group. Benign so far, if not creepy, as the Forest so obviously wanted them to know it was alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The air around the old hut smelled of seawater memories and distant loam despite being nestled atop a rocky cliff. Subtle, but obvious to anyone who had shorn and amended the Veil themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The seers spun the wheel and the entire room became motion as gears and pistons reconfigured themselves. The seers claimed that this let them see the future, as if a machine so complex approximated the universe, but who were we to argue when they were right more often than not.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Langam colonies were still unsettling to Dina, despite being ambassador for 4 years. Each hivemind communicated by thought and pheromones and silk, and so their towered cities were permeated by gossamer thread, sweet scents, and imagined song‚Äîbut no sound save scuttling.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Charles had anxiety. But c‚Äômon. The elevator between Nol Aleph and Nol Bet just had 5 millimeters of metal between him and eternal vacuum, and the ride took so long that there were beds. So much could go wrong and it would all be over so quick. But fuck him right?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Inakalka traders this far north was always odd, and they stood out in the summer heat still wrapped in their blue and green dyed furs as if warmth were a formality, not a necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to fall apart with time travel‚Äîat least as far as the bean counters were concerned‚Äîwas the UUID used to track each jump as parallel universes had matching entropy much of the time. This lead to the MUID which has been so far accepted as ‚Äúprobably fine, for now?‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The shrine was of a robed woman carved from sandstone, arms cradling a jug of ever flowing water. Her features were still sharp despite having been here as long as anyone could remember, her face still carved into a perpetual expression of stern disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Luna had spent the last 15 years in Tulukaruk dreaming of leaving. The sweltering heat of the geothermal forges kept the city alive, but the moment she thought she found respite from molten rock, the tundra would freeze her sweat-licked brow almost in an instant.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúYou know what it‚Äôs like for a memory to self replicate? It fucking sucks, Paul. It needs to be deleted entirely before it corrupts your entire mind, and afterward you know something was removed but know you‚Äôll never know what. There‚Äôs a reason our kind still dies of old age.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The moon flared its aurora brightly this morning, a welcome change from the last season of darkness. The Spires would be pleased, or so Grandmother said. She said she had seen them light up the sky with fire once, as a girl, days after the moon made it blue and green like now.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Steve woke to a notification he‚Äôd been waiting on for the past week. Well, more accurately, he‚Äôd been waiting 16 years, but 7.9 years for a message to get to Wolf 359, some time for Jeff to write, and 7.9 years to get back meant‚Äîrealistically‚Äîa reply would‚Äôve only come this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As the teleported broke down every molecule in her body, Lilith briefly felt the infinite as her mind untethered from 3space in the eternity it took for her brain to rebuild. There was always a worry that it wasn‚Äôt a perfect copy and some part of her mind would not anchor back.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>No raindrop thought itself responsible for a flood, but Anyil found that when you stopped them to talk, they did enjoy the idea of pooling with their siblings wherever the Speaker suggested.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The skies tonight were a powerful wash of yellow and green, and the gods‚Äô bronze faces were sparking and glowing as their power came manifest. The warriors knew to revere but not touch their swords lest they burn their hands.

They locked eyes, the rest of the ballroom consigned to a muted ringing. She felt it, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Risewell was right. Tonight would make quite a interesting evening indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Landen was vaguely aware that #13 was closing from behind, but ahead there was only sand, the keeper, and the tower. Down by one, a high goal would win it, but the keeper had been a monster in the arc. Landen could practically feel #13‚Äôs breath on his back. Now or never.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Mt Estrelya was a barren black spear from earth to heaven, a sudden cry from Mother Earth to push her realm to the sky. Yet when the peak nearly grasped the stars, Mother Sky froze the liquid rock in place. Nothing but ash has swirled the centuries since.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A gestalt of ravens was an impressive thing: a stories high formation of a thousand synchronized wings and an orchestra of caws modulated to form human speech in aggregate. Today they came to negotiate ownership of a particularly shiny skyscraper.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Her hair was touched by Fire, each lock a lick of flame glimpsed from Meravath‚Äôs domain and frozen into sun bright halos wreathing burned out eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The towers of Geval could be seen from leagues away, a testament to not just surviving the flood, but prospering. In the thousand years since the world sank beneath Orovan&#8217;s waves, countless kingdoms rose and fell, but only one stayed afloat throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúA whole wheel?‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúSpecifically from a Fyrdoen cow and aged 12 years.‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI, uh, have a 12 year from Gyloen.‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúNo no, the conjunction wasn‚Äôt even remotely affecting that area.

They came and went in a day, their deliberate pinprick steps somehow not disturbing the livestock with any tremors but unfortunately ruining the neighbor‚Äôs barley.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Elidyr almost preferred traversing the caverns without any light. The crystals were for him and the other elves and humans; the dwarves with their blind white eyes had an unerring sense of depth and knew every crack and crevice as soon as their tendrilous beards touched them.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>√áive plucked her thread from the air, a cool tingle spreading from where her finger tips briefly reached Between. Over 3, under 1, over 3, under 2. In theory, this pattern would bring luck, but if nothing else, it would look nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You awaken face down in sand, damp from salty tides rolling at your feet. As your eyes focus, you‚Äôre sure the shipwreck killed you‚Äîwhat at first seemed like a towering cliff is quarried stone forming a castle stretching impossibly in each direction as far as the eye can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In another life, perhaps they could be together, she said; the stars were not aligned in this one. Perhaps, perhaps. She thrusts the dagger into her abdomen and smiles, feeling her conscious slip to the next world while the suns flare their knell.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the deepest valley of the world there lies a single spot that the sun has not touched. The only light it gets is every 24 years when the far moon swings near, and only in that week of moonlight do the cobalt roses bloom, their crystalline thorns ringing maddeningly discordant.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The moonshard floating above Cithrel‚Äôs head cast an ethereal glow over the arcology. Cithrel looked to Adwae. He was on edge. While humans may have built these places, a thousand years had made them foreign to all‚Äîand humans didn‚Äôt find small comfort in the moon like the elves.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúEmpress 279, you are cleared to drop.‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThank the gods.

The 13 clergy-run towers counted 24 hours written in ecclesiastic script, and the rest used unique systems that their builders thought best‚Äîthat is, more obtuse than the last clock a rival built.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With enough synapses, animals gained awareness of self, awareness of the future, awareness of the universe. Surely a million trillion wires could do the same. And yet, with 73.1518% of the world repurposed, the Machine still found itself feeling nothing. Perhaps one more wire.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As the tail gunner, James had served just as long as Vaughan but never received half the accolades‚Äîthe riders could control the beasts, and a dragon by your side was always impressive.

The boy took out his phone and took several selfies then jumped off with his glide suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>No one could say when the sky first began to crumble, just to avoid looking where the blues and oranges and blacks had peeled away like weatherworn paints on a forgotten canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Every 894 years, the seven greatest mountain ranges in the world would shake as the titans that had slept under them awoke. From a distance, their gargantuan ritual could almost be described as a dance‚Äîbeautiful, alien, and forgotten. Few lived to describe a closer point of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Calico whipped his phasecycle down the lower streets of Mania, calmly glitching through unperturbed jay walkers busy with their own affairs. Above, the neon lights of the tiered highways shone, a constant reminder of tolls and debts that even the fastest courier couldn‚Äôt escape.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The oceans of Allorec by all accounts of initial explorers seemed normal enough, yet upon further study, was found to be a natural ferrofluid. Changes in viscosity and movement of currents aligned with the planet‚Äôs strong magnetic fields, yielding an almost orderly weather system</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The streets of Saphtesh were always dark. The sun never rose on the city, locked as it was to the maelstrom side, but at least tonight both Nasetera and Leipra hung in the sky full and shining.</p>\n","date":"May 1st, 2021","tags":[{"name":"microfiction","slug":"microfiction"},{"name":"microfiction 2021","slug":"microfiction-2021"}]},{"title":"Microfiction March 2021","slug":"microfiction-march-2021","excerpt":"<p>I decided to tweet out microfiction every day of 2021.

He transferred it to a runed alembic and almost as soon as the vessel closed, red ether began to drip into a waiting inkwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Chameleon suits were all the rage in Slide City, not to blend in, but to strut apart from the crowd.

With the aliens, time travelers, interdimensional intersection, and so on, the old gods demanding a cult just seemed so pass√©.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This was his favorite moment: that last step over the threshold where the Storm gave way to the Edge, the moment you went from sand stinging your eyes to having the clearest view of the stars below your feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Adon leaned against Harvel. There was never silence on the Galileo, and the helmets always made things awkward&#8230; but it was hard to not be romantic with a rising Io sparkling a new plume overhead and the constant aurora and swirling clouds below.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúLine 1 advance!

Moments later, Cota crested a far hill, her rusted wings flapping once for altitude and her talons clutched tight around a fat hare. She was an old ornial, but she still glinted in Tamachag&#8217;s eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúIf it stretches across the entire cylinder does it really count as ‚Äòthe tallest building on Eden‚Äô?‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThe most advanced metamaterial construction project post-launch and your first question is semantics?‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI mean it‚Äôs more of a pillar than a building, right?‚Äù </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúMark.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There is exactly 16 minutes deep rumbling that you can feel rather than hear before the siyara begins to move, taking the city on its back with it.

Clean forest floors meant the grinlek had swarmed through here already. Hopefully they had passed days ago and it was only the swarm behind her left.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The Writhing Fields were the exact kind of nightmare that Hastios was expecting and dreading. The ground was covered in tangled, sickly vines, necrotic magic ironically the only thing keeping them alive‚Äîand aggressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When the first cube on Ganymede was found, the world simultaneously debated and held its breath for the next couple decades until Galapagos could land with investigative instruments for intelligent life. Historians often mark this as the clear inflection point before the End.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Nidinta applied another layer of dragons blood to her horse‚Äôs carapace, polishing it to perfect silver sheen and clean enough to see the greens and blues of the Bridge in the reflection. One day she would make it up there. Perhaps not today, but one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Always seemed a shame that in order to hop to the next timeline, one had to destroy something in the current one. Hopefully this was the last one. Charlie sighed and muttered a spell, amethyst flame consuming the 221 pounds of gold before him, then vanished himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Beware the trap of tyrants and cowards: so easy to sacrifice a kingdom yet so difficult to give up a home. Only a fool or a child would find comfort or refuge in such simplistic thinking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚Äîfrom the letters of Empress Dowager Suha to Prince Dalandan of Atis</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúRemember to hydrate!‚Äù it said, another tick of temptation added to the pile.

She smiled. The kings could play at their wars, thinking a thousand lives for a dynasty dramatic and worthy of song, when in reality, a few strokes on old parchment would bring it all down with only one head.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It felt like every bill to stay connected to the Cortex was higher than the last, and the work to be found within was less fulfilling each time. Maybe it was time to become a psi-farmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The crew was in place, each soul in the theoretically correct spot around the m-drive to draw the correct flow of energy around the approaching leyline. 10, 9, 8. Aviels checked her math one more time. 5, 4. Everything seemed in order&#8230; wait was Ensign Zaloir‚Äî</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>So does she sleep, the dreamer of all, <br>The goddess who gives us the night. <br>Play in the garden, do your duties above, <br>Make deals with her phantoms and wights. <br>But be quick and be quiet lest her rest wane too early, <br>And call morning to burn all in her light.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Of course prior attempts to transfer a mind from one body to the next; the transfers all focused on the 4 dimensional extrusion of a 7D object. This was it. These were the equations needed to define the boundaries of consciousness and govern its movement. Immortality at last.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The frozen winds bit what parts of S√¶lmar‚Äôs face that could not be covered with layers of cloth and fur; ifhe didn‚Äôt find the Underground soon, his servos would be frozen shut. Trying to convince a bunch of humans to let in a synth was hard enough even with a working jaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Like all the others in Matiek, they wore a sash patterned to their station, and the sigils indicated the couple was of a First Family. However, their house colors were blue and gold. The archon would be sashed in purple, but Sho could not tell which of them was wearing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The 1942th floor of Arcology Rho was a multi-story atrium purpose-built to watch cumulonumimbus clouds roll under and around you from behind the safety of quantum glass. The danger of lightning and sound of thunder were all academic concerns to the citizens who were born here.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Much like DNA, something of the mind was lost on every copy, each dream some final metaphysical outburst as memories shunted from one side of REM to the other. This was fine until now. The brain died after a century or two, but the soul never evolved to defend against millennia.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When a teleportation spell big enough to disappear the big boat was found, the world laughed, cried, and cheered. About 1000 years later, humanity would learn the spell had been temporal-sympathetic, not spatial, as the ship showed up stuck in a hyperspace lane.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The first breath back from cryo wasn&#8217;t anything dramatic‚Äîdue to the sedatives, it was like blinking, except someone different standing over your tube.

You have no family, no friends, and no where to go. After 5 years living like this, a man in a fancy black suit walks by where you&#8217;re begging and hands you a blank check. Then he says &#8220;Knock yourself out, kid.&#8221;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You blink, astonished. The man smiles, holding out a neat rectangle of paper. In the dim grey of 5AM, you can still recognize what a check looks like, and a second glance confirms your suspicion: a signature is scrawled where a signature should go, but nothing is written where the dollars should go. Five years may as well be an eternity, but an eternity isn&#8217;t long enough to forget the last check you wrote, that damn bounced check that your shithead of a landlord called &#8220;the final straw,&#8221; yet the straw broke your back, not his.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve never seen this man before. He&#8217;s handsome: sharp cheeks, twin shocks of grey touching the sides of slicked black hair, a suit so perfectly tailored it passes beauty and almost disgusts you. Sure, you were hoping for the generosity of a stranger wreathed in so much wealth, but a blank check?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; is all you manage to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A blank check, that much should be obvious.&#8221; His voice is like caramel. &#8220;Pick a bank, fill in some numbers, and act out your heart&#8217;s desires.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your hand starts to move from underneath your itchy, hole-ridden blanket, but you hesitate. &#8220;What&#8217;s the catch?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The catch?&#8221; He laughs, booming, too loud for this hour in Central Park. &#8220;Just knock yourself out, kid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gently thrusts the check forward and, this time, you don&#8217;t hesitate to snatch your ticket out of here. You stare at him, waiting for the dream to end, and when it doesn&#8217;t, you stare down. The check is still blank. The signature is still there. The company name and address,&nbsp;<em>Mephistopheles Inc</em>, doesn&#8217;t change into jibberish. That coarse feel of paper in your hand is real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t know how long you&#8217;ve been staring down, but when you look up, the sky is brighter and the man seem to have walked away. There&#8217;s a black pen on the ground, same company branding. How accommodating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten thousand. That should be enough to get you out of this dump and on your way. As pen approaches paper, a knot in your stomach forms. What if it bounces? Then you&#8217;ll have nothing. Maybe just a thousand&#8230; you mark the one, then the zero, then another, then stop again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe this is just a joke. Maybe there&#8217;s a camera waiting to see what you do. Maybe in that case&#8230; you mark two zeroes and smirk. You have nothing now, if it&#8217;s a joke, then might as well make something of it. If it&#8217;s not, that man&#8217;s suit could easily handle ten grand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then maybe&#8230;. was ten thousand enough to really do much besides a couple weeks of pampering? You could probably get yourself on your feet if you really focused, kept everything as lean as you&#8217;d done for the last five years. Five years. Don&#8217;t you deserve at least a little bit of runway, and a little bit of fun?&nbsp;<em>Knock youreslf out, kid.</em>&nbsp;Ah, what the hell. You mark an extra zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The teller at the bank gives you a funny look when you approach, but doesn&#8217;t blink when she looks at the check, nor when you ask for cash. You&#8217;re confident that it truly is a joke at this point, so you go all in. When she hands you a neat pile of 100s, you both smile, and you wait for the other shoe to drop. It doesn&#8217;t, and a line is forming behind you so you leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You push open the bank&#8217;s doors. Surely they&#8217;ll come now. Nothing happens while you look around. It&#8217;s morning, and the wave of people starting their 9‚Äì5 shift around you, as uncaring of you as they are of the lamp post behind you. You almost feel disappointment, then anxiety. There is so much money under your shaggy clothes. You hurry back to the park. The man will be there to laugh at you, he will take most of his money back but maybe leave you some, and it will all go on youtube or whatever the kids use these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day turns to night and no one comes. The money burns a hole in your pocket. Paranoia turns to a need for shelter, so you decide to book a cheap motel room. It feels good to have a roof over you while you sleep. It feels good to luxuriate in a hot shower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another day comes and no one comes. Then another. And another. By this point, you&#8217;ve cleaned your hair, bought new clothes, and moved to a 5 star hotel. To hell with it. This $100k is yours, and you&#8217;re gonna use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steak dinner. Brunch with a rooftop view of manhattan. $20 cocktails don&#8217;t mean anything to you. Carousing with beautiful people feels easy within a few weeks of opening up your pocket book. Doing drugs with them in the bathroom falls into place as just another regularity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One night, the two flings you meet convince you pull out your phone and rent something fast and something hot, and that line of coke says that&#8217;s a great idea. It&#8217;s amazing what technology has done in the last five years, and within moments, the three of you are making noise down 2nd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Knock yourself out, kid.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your drug addled eyes spot the light changing in time, but your drug addled senses say go go go and there&#8217;s the gnashing of metal and crunching of glass and bone and‚Äî</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You blink, astonished.

It wasn&#8217;t just a comment about the dry heat&#8211;not to say that Duchess Azamach didn&#8217;t do the usual thing other Princes did of turning their little slice of the 86th into a literal convection oven, efficient air flow and all. His question, I think, was more due to the fact that we were surrounded by two story townhouses repeating as far as the eye could see&#8211;which was pretty far given that the entire plane was flat. Ignoring the orange glow from the eternal fire blanketing the sky, and ignoring that the cacti had veins, and ignoring that the tumbleweed screamed as it rolled by, I could be convinced that we were in some desert suburbia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Demons are a weird bunch.&#8221; I shrugged as I applied some chapstick before all this heat could crack my lips. This was the sixth time already. &#8220;A lot of fascination with the hells we humans make for ourselves in the mortal plane.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was expecting&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Torture, depravity, people crawling all over like something out of Caligula&#8217;s wet dreams?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Caligula?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought you were taking Latin this year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I, uh, may have missed that day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hadn&#8217;t had to write any notes to the school nurse this year&#8230; though that could have explained the pile of feathers I found in the trash a month back. &#8220;Did you use Usiwyn&#8217;s or Ekey&#8217;s forgery spell?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; Ekey&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221; Usiwyn was a hack. &#8220;Anyway, the depravity you&#8217;re thinking of exists in places. Everything you can think of and everything you can&#8217;t pretty much exists in the Endless Hells. Ever wonder what demons actually do with the sacrifices they collect?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried not to.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a game. Everything about Hell is about status. People think it&#8217;s about domination, but really, domination is just one way to establish that you are higher on the pecking order. The difference between status in the mortal plane and status in Hell is that status in Hell actually gives demons the power to make and shape things.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Uh huh.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was losing him. &#8220;Martin, the point of all this is that demons have been doing deals for a long time. There&#8217;s a whole complex economy based purely on hierarchy, promises, and wishes down here, so once we start talking to anyone, just keep quiet. Especially since you forgot how the Contract of Equivalence works.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I know how it works, Aunt Veronica.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh? Tell me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin sighed. &#8220;Humans and demons may exchange goods and services that are equal in value. Nothing can be given or taken freely.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I waited for him to continue. He didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Equal as defined as? Value as defined as? Free as defined as?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin looked askance. &#8220;Um.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As defined by a third party arbitrator and witness, agreed upon by all parties prior to signing.&#8221; This was usually the part where demons took advantage of folks not familiar with dealings since a &#8220;third party&#8221; wasn&#8217;t necessarily someone who wouldn&#8217;t benefit. That loophole and all the fine print were always an adventure. Given that Martin completely forgot about the arbitrator clause, I wasn&#8217;t holding my breath on if he understood the full terms. He didn&#8217;t even have a copy of the contract, which is why we were passing through Azamach&#8217;s offices first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dowsing bracelet gave a gentle tug toward a house on the right. Finally. The streets were entirely empty; there were no cars nor were there people. There was the occasional screaming tumbleweed that bounced by, but one seemed to come on an interval like clockwork. Every single house looked exactly the same, with the same arrangement of veiny cacti on the front yard. It was as if we were walking through an agonizing facsimile of Groundhog Day, except the loops happened at every mailbox. Couldn&#8217;t even get a full day to breathe. Gods, Azamach was good at her job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over there. Remember, don&#8217;t speak to anyone except me. Last thing we need is another accidental contract.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin just nodded before wiping sweat from his face using the front of his shirt. I was glad that Sophie instilled enough responsibility in him to do his own laundry before she absconded. Teenage boys stink, and his hellspawned sweat stains were not inspiring confidence. Though the only reason I seemed to be fairing better than him was because I was wearing all black. Cliche for a witch, sure, but black doesn&#8217;t show sweat or ink or blood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knocked on the door and waited for a moment before it swung open accompanied by a rattling of metal on metal. Standing behind the doorway was what was likely the source of the sound: a humanoid shaped pile of what seemed like animated chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Veronica?&#8221; the chains said. I recognized that voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Suzy?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh my God, so good to see you!&#8221; Suzy shuffled forward and wrapped an uncomfortable hug around me. I hugged her back. Suzy Ford was a friend of a friend of a friend I&#8217;d met a couple times; the kind of person that I had absolutely no positive or negative feelings about. The best way I could describe her was that she was just kinda&#8230; there. Last I saw her, she&#8217;d broken some fine print and had to serve her punishment in Hell. From what I knew, the punishment itself should have been over, but I guess she stuck around to serve a few more years as a kind of investment. It was a pretty common thing. Since demons and humans couldn&#8217;t do even the most basic things for free for each other&#8211;such as opening a door&#8211;demons would use indentured humans to do such things for them. If it wasn&#8217;t part of some punishment, then it was usually in exchange for flexibility in future contracts or other kinds of power access. Kinda like a shitty internship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You too,&#8221; I lied. &#8220;Can we come in?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suzy stepped to the side. &#8220;Yes, please, Veronica, and&#8211;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My nephew, Martin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Martin, are invited and welcome inside. So, what brings you in town?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stepped through the threshold, feeling a familiar shiver as two things happened simultaneously. First was the feeling of a hospitality charm washing over me. Second was the air conditioning. Gods. Putting that here was pure evil, knowing that anyone who came in to this momentary oasis would have to step back outside to the literal hellscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, my nephew made his first deal and, you know how it goes, it wasn&#8217;t great. So I was hoping to see the boss?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suzy let out a sardonic laugh. &#8220;Oh, I know that feeling. Unfortunately, though, Azamach&#8217;s busy leading a battalion against Broglamoth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Of course she is.&#8221; Azamach was merciful at times, and was usually one of the fair ones when trading favors. Given that Sarzallon swore fealty to her, I was hoping to speak with her and get some leverage. Alas. &#8220;Can we at least get a copy of the contract?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I remember forgetting to get a copy of my first contract, too,&#8221; Suzy said. &#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foyer of the townhouse was almost exactly what you would expect from seeing it on the outside: standard, suburban America decor. Suzy led us past some stairs and into what could have been a living room, except where a coffee table would be was a stone altar with an 8ft tall demon standing behind it. They looked more like a fallen angel than a demon born here: no horns, completely androgynous features, alabaster skin. Bright crimson veins crawled like spiderwebs over their skin, though, and their eyes were pure black. Atop the altar was one of those old spaceship-looking iMacs that the demon was currently using to scroll through Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hey Tabris,&#8221; Suzy said. &#8220;Got some folks with a contract request.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tabris looked up. &#8220;Go on.&#8221; Their voice had a deep velvet and caramel feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Martin, will you witness this deal?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Martin asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just say &#8216;yes.'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Uh. Yes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I fished around in my purse to pull out a notebook, pen, and some cash, then set them all on the altar. I flipped open the notebook and started writing as I spoke. &#8220;I, Veronica Morgan, wish to trade this $10 bill for a copy of the contract between Martin Smith and Lord Sarzallon, made yesterday trading the Bow of the Eternal for an ounce of weed. Martin, do you find the terms of my trade equivalent?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;$10?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Martin could start speculating out loud in front of Tabris, I explained. &#8220;They&#8217;re both printed pieces of paper that encode a promise backed by the full authority of some nebulous entity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin tilted his head. &#8220;I guess that makes sense?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tabris, do you agree to the terms?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; they said without any hesitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I signed my name on the piece of paper and pushed it over to Tabril. They did the same then turned to the computer. They typed some things, clicked a few more things, and about three minutes later, I had a print out of Sarzallon&#8217;s contract. Without asking, I plopped down on an empty couch, pulled out my reading glasses, and started going over the fine print.</p>\n","date":"April 22nd, 2018","tags":[{"name":"witch lawyer veronica","slug":"witch-lawyer-veronica"},{"name":"writing prompt","slug":"writing-prompt"}]},{"title":"Witch Lawyer Veronica","slug":"witch-lawyer-veronica","excerpt":"<p>[WP] You are a drug dealer who deals in drugs nobody else can get.

His face was stretched into that nervous, side-eyed expression I almost recognized from my sister. I waited for him to continue. The black cat clock on the wall ticked, mocking his silence. After enough time passed that even I was getting uncomfortable, I said &#8220;Today was&#8230;?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;4/20.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pushed my glasses up to rub my temples in an attempt to massage away the stupid that had just entered my head. That&#8217;s what I was smelling underneath the brimstone. &#8220;Jesus Christ, Martin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought it would look really cool if I like, did the whole warlock thing and got us some weed. Weed&#8217;s not that big of a deal, Aunt Veronica!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I breathed out a long, long sigh. &#8220;No, Martin, it&#8217;s not that big of a deal. You could have just asked me, Martin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You smoke?&#8221; Martin&#8217;s eyes were wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Are you kidding me?

One thing led to another and, well, I ended up trading the book for an ounce.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You WHAT?!?&#8221; I was fighting an intense rise of anger now. Before this high teenager could react, I pinched his wrist and bit the inside of my lip, just enough to taste the barest hint of copper.

I might have pinched him harder than necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Contract of Equivalence, Martin! Did I not teach you anything? I know a guy in the First Layer who only needs two tiny sacrifices of pain so our deal can satisfy the barest minimum letter of the Contract. The *Bow of the Eternal* is a one-of-a-kind book, not just on Earth but in the entire multiverse! It literally cannot be copied because of all the elder amethyst in its ink, and you thought it was only worth an ounce of weed?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin was silent. It was enough time for me to realize that the summonings in that book were not exactly for novices either. As Martin grew older, I had more and more gotten used to this weird feeling of combined pride in his abilities and absolute disappointment at his stupidity. The trade must have happened with at least one of the marquises. I took another deep breath before I could yell at him again. Patience, Veronica. I suppose I&#8217;d done some dumb trades in the past, as well&#8230; I shivered slightly remembering what I had offered to get rid of my acne once. Of course I wouldn&#8217;t tell him that story until he had learned from this mistake. Had to keep the pretense of responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Who did you trade with?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sarzallon from the 86th sphere.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Good God. Sarzallon? Really? That motherfucker‚Äîdon&#8217;t smirk at my language‚Äîhas been after my collection for years. Of course it was him.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started pacing around the room, taking mental inventory of what I needed to open a portal to the 86th. Couldn&#8217;t do this over the phone‚ÄîSarzallon wouldn&#8217;t take that as an insult, but from my dealings he was easier to work with face to face. I was rummaging around in the minifridge to find that last bag of AB+ blood I knew was in there when I caught Martin trying to slowly back out of the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Stop right there, young man.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He froze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not off the hook. Fill the camelbak with water. It&#8217;s hot in Hell and we need to stay hydrated.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; There was a quiver to his voice. He hadn&#8217;t been down there before. &#8220;You&#8217;re&#8230; not going to trade me for your book, are you?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cackled. &#8220;No, of course not. Well, the thought crossed my mind. A human soul would *probably* be a good enough trade to get back the *Bow of the Eternal*, but no, I wouldn&#8217;t do that to you. We&#8217;re related, and having part of the bloodline bound to a demon is usually not great.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Is that the only reason?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Of course not. Now go fill the camelbak.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin uneasily grabbed the bag and left the room, and I opened my third eye to make sure his aura was headed toward the kitchen, not up the stairs. Once I saw him standing at the sink and heard water rushing through the pipes, I pulled out one of my tarot decks and began shuffling, guiding The Chariot‚Äîno, The Wheel of Fortune would be better for the 86th‚Äîto the top. I threw the bloodbag onto the floor and stomped on it, muttering a quick spell so that the splatter would form into a heptagram. I tore up the card and threw it in the air, and almost as soon as I had done that, my office wall opened 86 human eyes of various colors. They all blinked spastically before all erupting into hot, orange flame and coalescing into a single, burning portal. I waved a hand, willing the window open and a blanket over the fire detector as thick smoke billowed out of the rift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin came back into the room, though he came to a dead stop at the sight of the portal. I walked over to him and took his hand, gently but firmly, then went guided him over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nothing really prepares a first timer for the screams, so‚Äî&#8221; I just stepped into the portal, pulling Martin along with me.</p>\n","date":"April 21st, 2018","tags":[{"name":"witch lawyer veronica","slug":"witch-lawyer-veronica"},{"name":"writing prompt","slug":"writing-prompt"}]},{"title":"Windseer: Chapter 1","slug":"windseer-chapter-1","excerpt":"<p>The sky over Dagat faded from fiery orange to roiling grey with the setting sun as it did for as long as history could remember.

Not long after thick clouds enveloped the western horizon did pitch black night fall over the land. This did not come as a surprise to Dagat&#8217;s oceanlife; the smallest of them began to glow soft blues and greens, inexplicably drawn to the leylines that criss-crossed from horizon to horizon across the seas. The black night was also not particularly noteworthy to the people living in and around the Daanan Archipelago; candles, lanterns, and lamps in the humblest homes of the smallest villages to the sprawling manors in the largest cities had already been lit during cloudfall and were well ready to burn away the encroaching darkness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the port city of Simulan, one of these lanterns burned above a tavern called the Oak and Ale, and just outside its circle of light and the main throng of the evening crowds, Jasna de la Plata sat cross-legged in the dirt asking any passerby for something to eat. She was as thin as her begging implied, with dark brown skin and short dark hair‚Äîhardly notable amongst the other street urchins besides not being so offensive as to scare away any patrons to the Oak and Ale. Jas had seen the other boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; more confrontational acts with the sailors and merchants that frequented the tavern, and she had seen the thickset proprietor beat them away with his broom. To her, however, the man had simply turned up his nose. Most others did the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas liked that. Being invisible was good. It was easier to lift a purse when no one could see you past their chin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crowd inside the Oak and Ale was lively. Voices in conversation and hints of song spilled out of the rows of open doors that made up the facade of the tavern. Despite the pitch black darkness, the air was still thick with heat and moisture. Jas slapped a mosquito on her shoulder before it could bite her then turned her attention back to the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oak and Ale was clean, though it had no airs about it, and was located only a few roads from the harbor, so the clientele was as expected: sailors from the nicer merchant ships rather than the rough and tumble types. Most paid no attention to the beggar as they walked into the establishment, and more paid no attention as they stumbled out. It was the latter set of people that Jas paid attention, though she was not so foolish as to stare at them; just last week, the proprietor chased away a pair of younger boys doing just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Jas kept her eyes on the ground and made a show of politely asking people who had already walked past the Oak and Ale&#8217;s doors for a bite to eat. Those people never stopped to give Jas the time of day, so while she said the words and held her hand out, she could close her eyes and focus at the edge of her senses to feel when the time was right to pick a distracted drunk&#8217;s pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas heard footsteps tapping from around the corner down an alleyway‚Äîand she couldn&#8217;t say why, but she felt like it must have been someone who had just finished relieving themselves. Jas stole a glance at a sailor stepping out of the Oak and Ale with his arm around a handsome young man that the girl recognized from three buildings down. The girl thought for a second: if she was right, the two parties would collide a few feet to her right. She scooted over, making it look like she was just standing up to stretch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In just a few moments, the scene played out as Jas had thought it might: some dockhand had walked out of the alleyway just as the two drunk men stumbled forward, colliding. There was a moment of confusion, chest beating, apologies, and finally everyone going about their business as if nothing had happened. Of course, something had happened: Jas was now richer by one sailor&#8217;s coin pouch. She tested the weight of the purse while holding it behind her back. Twenty two copper chips; almost an entire stack! Jas stifled a grin and slipped the pouch into a pocket she had stitched inside the back of her trousers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a copper stack, she&#8217;d be able to feed herself for a week, even buy some cloth to fix the holes in her shirt, but the girl decided to stick around and try her luck a bit longer. There was nowhere else to go, after all. Jas had nowhere to truly call her home. Most nights, she slept above a stable a few blocks away in a spot shielded from the season&#8217;s rains by the awning next door and out of reach from stray dogs. But it was still too early to go there; people were still awake and might catch her sneaking up. Jas&#8217; stomach grumbled as if it wanted her to find food immediately now that there was money, but the markets had already closed before cloudfall, and with the evening crowds not yet beginning to thin, no tavern would waste their time with a dirty urchin girl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas sat back down and went back to her act. She hunched her shoulders and held up a hand, keeping her eyes downcast. A pair of slim leather boots, worn but well-oiled, and held up with a few more buckles than strictly necessary entered Jas&#8217; vision. &#8220;Excuse me, <em>ate</em>, spare a bite to eat?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas was in the middle of instinctively drawing her hand back when she noticed that the boots had stopped walking and were now turned toward at the girl. There was the vague sound of a chuckle. &#8220;I have a feeling I&#8217;m too old to be your <em>ate</em>. What&#8217;s your name, girl?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas was taken aback for a moment. It was rare that anyone stopped to even acknowledge the girl, let alone talk to her. She shook herself from her surprise so she could look up. &#8220;Miss?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the dim lamp light, Jas could make out sharp cheek bones framing a soft smile. The barest web of lines highlighted the dark skin around her eyes and brow. The woman squatted down slowly, getting eye level with the girl. She had the faint smell of charcoal. &#8220;Something tells me that &#8216;Miss&#8217; isn&#8217;t your name.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Um. Jasna. My name&#8217;s Jasna. Or Jas&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you, Jas. My name is Lys. Would you care to join me for dinner?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas had been confused, but now she was worried. This had to be some kind of trap. Was this woman an enforcer, and had she caught Jas stealing? Or maybe was it worse: what if she was a slaver? Jas pulled back and shook her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lys cocked an eyebrow. &#8220;Are you sure? You did just ask me for food.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I, um‚Äî&#8221; Jas sputtered. &#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry just now. I, uh, just want some bread for later.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221; Lys smiled despite the incredulity in her voice. &#8220;Well, give me a moment.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman stood up and strode into the Oak and Ale. Jas&#8217; eyes darted around, searching the surrounding crowds. Maybe this was part of the trap, and an accomplice would snatch her. After many tense heartbeats, Jas was fairly sure there was no one. Something in her gut told her, and in the years she&#8217;d been on the streets, her sense for danger was rarely wrong. The thought of running anyway crossed her mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After she was extra sure no one was coming toward her, Jas peeked into the Oak and Ale. She saw Lys handing a pair of coppers to the big man behind the counter, who in turn handed her an oval loaf of brown bread the size of her full hand. Jas watched as the woman strode back outside and came back to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Expensive bread here.&#8221; Lys chuckled, then handed the entire loaf to Jas. It was still soft. Jas could barely remember the last time she had bread this soft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I, um&#8230; thank you, miss,&#8221; Jas said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very welcome. Well, my ship is anchored here for another few days. If we happen to cross paths again, the offer stands.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jas didn&#8217;t say anything. Lys simply smiled, then walked off. Almost as soon as the woman had turned her back, Jas ducked into an alleyway and sprinted away.</p>\n","date":"November 2nd, 2017","tags":[{"name":"dagat","slug":"dagat"},{"name":"nanowrimo","slug":"nanowrimo"},{"name":"windseer","slug":"windseer"}]},{"title":"Windseer: Prologue","slug":"windseer-prologue","excerpt":"<p>Captain Lina Maringal barked an order to tack hard into the swordwinds, loud enough to be heard over the thunder of cannons barely five hundred yards behind.

The twin masts of the <em>Queen Marie</em> leaned larboard in time for a pair of spinning chains to whip past the outer edge of her mainsail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina&#8217;s eyes were closed, not from fear, but from concentration. There was a leyline not too far beyond the horizon, and Lina could feel it calling to her like a second heartbeat thrumming deep in her chest. Where there was a leyline, there were ships, and where there were ships, there might be help. There might also be more Commonwealth. It was a gamble she would take on the Andallan side of the Arc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She took a breath, the smell of sulfur lingering heavy over the sprays of salt. The pirates‚Äî&#8221;privateers&#8221; as they fancied themselves‚Äîwere exactly 503 yards behind her own ship, the <em>Queen Marie</em>, and gaining. She could feel this distance from the waves underfoot, and worse, she could feel the pursuing ship&#8217;s weight pressing into the sea as if it were a rock digging into her own flesh. The other ship was bigger than the <em>Queen Marie</em>, flying three masts as opposed to the <em>Queen&#8217;s</em> two, and sported two decks of guns as opposed to the <em>Queen&#8217;s</em> none. Lina could hear the shouts of her hunters&#8217; bow gunners, and she listened for the rattle of chains that would indicate another shot was coming. Wait, didn&#8217;t the enemy have four chasers? Lina felt a telltale flicker of warmth at the back of her neck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;BRACE!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No sooner than Lina had ducked did a another pair of cannonballs whip overhead. She heard a monstrous crash intermingled with screams as the <em>Queen&#8217;s</em> rigging exploded into great splinters of wood and snapping lines over everyone&#8217;s head. She knew it was the mainmast before she opened her eyes, yet it pained her even more once she did. Lina&#8217;s head swam. Could they have loaded the second pair of chase guns while the first pair distracted her on puprose?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Queen Marie&#8217;s</em> mainmast was seconds from splitting and falling starboard, length of chain and lead bitten into its midpoint. At the foot of the wooden shaft lay what looked like Mr. Tasa; at least Lina thought it to be Mr. Tasa given that half his head was missing. Lina locked eyes with Mr. Girsang as he scrambled down, then turned away as she could feel the inevitable cracking in her bones. Mr. Girsang screamed as the tangle of wood and rope and sail took him into the sea. Lina stifled vomit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Get those ropes cut, or we&#8217;re all dead!&#8221; Lina recognized the rough growl of her bosun, Cedro Dilaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Lina said, rushing to the side of the ship. She looked among the wreckage for any sign of Mr. Girsang, hoping, praying every prayer she could think that the man could be saved, even though she felt no sign of struggle from the waves lapping at the side of the <em>Queen Marie</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Belay the captain&#8217;s orders, keep cutting,&#8221; Cedro said, his gruff voice complementing his gruff mood. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, we can&#8217;t wait. You can feel the Queen keeling as better than I, and with this drag we&#8217;ll never get away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even with the mainmast, theirs was the faster ship.&#8221; Lina sighed. &#8220;Raise the white.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Lina stood on the port gunwale and watched as the pirates drew closer. No, not pirates. Privateers. Over their personal standard‚Äîa simple golden crown‚Äîthey flew another flag showing a red field with a diagonal blue cross and yellow sun in the center. The Commonwealth of Oronya. The sailors of the approaching ship weren&#8217;t killing on a whim; they were commissioned by the damned Commonwealth to harass ships of the newly declared Andalla Republic. To keep the pretense of a just empire, the Commonwealth didn&#8217;t send their armada and called the alternative a mercy. Nothing to do with ongoing war with the Saraqet Empire, they said, as if as soon as the war was won‚Äîprobably within the next few years-‚Äîthey wouldn&#8217;t turn the full force of the navy this way. Lina&#8217;s grip tightened on the gunwale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bastards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sun had fallen below the horizon, and cloudfall was well on its way. The privateers held no urgency in their approach; by the time their ship was alongside the <em>Queen Marie</em>, thick grey clouds had already crawled across half the sky. Lina felt the wind through her hair and estimated only twenty minutes before cloudfall was complete, and another fifteen until pitch black night enveloped the world. Lina nodded to Cedro, and the man waved some of the less nervous crew members down to light the deck lanterns. Lina didn&#8217;t take her eyes off the other ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The privateers came to a short stop alongside the <em>Queen Marie</em>, the size difference even more exaggerated now that it was close. The privateer crew began lobbing grappling hooks across the water down onto the <em>Queen&#8217;s</em> deck, and neither Lina nor Cedro made any move to instruct the crew to help tie them off. It was a petty act‚Äîthe hooks for the most part held fast and the privateer ship heaved closer‚Äîbut what respect was due to someone below even a soldier of fortune?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sailors on the privateer ship stood at lazy attention, flintlocks pointed in no particular direction. The <em>Queen Marie&#8217;s</em> crew had disarmed themselves. She was a merchant ship, and her sailors simple traders, not fighters. An act of spite such as bearing arms was not worth their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the other ship drew closer, Lina&#8217;s attention was drawn to a middle-aged man standing with a leg raised on the gunwale, though as sure-footed as if he had been carved from the same wood that made the ship. He was perhaps in his late thirties, though so sun-baked as to look like he was in his forties. His skin was a darker brown than even Lina&#8217;s, though the mane of hair framing his face was a nearly white blonde, not black. He stared directly at Lina, a dangerous grin on his face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well met, my friends!&#8221; the man called out. His voice was higher than Lina had imagined. She made no move to return his greeting. The man simply grinned wider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the gap between ships had shrunken enough, some of the man&#8217;s crew dropped a length of wood to bridge the two vessels. The man, strode across confidently, followed by a dozen ruffians, all waving their weapons in an obvious attempt to intimidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My name is Flynn Locke, captain of the <em>Crown of Gold</em>,&#8221; the man said. In one hand he held a writ with an official seal, presumably his privateering license. He extended his other hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>His name&#8217;s Flynn Locke? Really? </em>Lina kept her hands behind her back and her jaw square. &#8220;Captain Lina Maringal of the‚Äî&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;‚Äîof the <em>Queen Marie</em>, yes, yes.&#8221; Locke chuckled, or at least made some throaty sound approximating a chuckle. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got that name plastered along your ship&#8217;s hull as if you can afford to have it repainted at every port.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No pretense about preying on a merchant ship you assume with riches, then?&#8221; Lina spat at him. &#8220;The manifest is in my quarters; take whatever you want and begone with you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Quite the temper there, Ms. Maringal.&#8221; Locke faked a pout to accompany his unsubtle sleight. He nodded to a sharp-nosed woman behind himself who then stalked toward the quarterdeck. &#8220;And I admit no such thing. Surely a ship sailing so far from the nearest leyline would raise your suspicions as well. It is our duty to protect these waters from pirates, smugglers, and more. It says so right on this paper.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men behind Locke laughed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So tell me, why were you and yours so far from the leyline?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We lost sight of the Line of Caracal after the last storm,&#8221; Lina lied. As a rule, humans could not count themselves amongst the many creatures naturally attracted to leylines. Instead, they had to wait for nightfall to see the glowing clouds of sprites that swam over the lines. However, perhaps one in a thousand was born a Reader and could feel the leylines&#8217; pull. Fewer still had the Sight like Lina, the ability to feel the world around them as if the ocean were an extention of the body. Locke was not incorrect in his suspicion of a ship sailing far from the leylines; the <em>Queen Marie </em>was indeed smuggling food and supplies to an openly rebellious region of Andalla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man let out a loud guffaw. &#8220;Lost sight? My Reader tells me the Line of Caracal is in the direction our ships are pointed this very moment, and you want to tell me that you just happened to go in that direction as soon as you saw us on the horizon? I&#8217;ll admit that the promise of taking some cargo from some storm-swallowed smuggler intrigued me, but finding out there was another Reader on board?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina clenched her hands harder behind her back to hold back their waver, but she kept her eyes steady with Locke&#8217;s. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you do. Tell me, Ms. Maringal, do you know how hard it is to track a Reader?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina just glared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; Locke said, his white smile looking more like a predator ready to strike rather than a bemused man. &#8220;A Reader doesn&#8217;t need to stay near leylines like us common folk, clinging to them like a babe to a teat. With that kind of freedom, the seas are a vast, vast place, and ships are so very small. But every ship has a destination and every captain has his quirks, my friend, and that is something that a common man with wit and intelligence can use to find, predict, and in the end, hunt.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Your point?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My point is that my friends and I have spent a good deal of time and capital hunting Readers because it is a difficult endeavour, and the Commonwealth pays handsomely for this particular kind of difficult endeavour. Enough crowns for each man aboard my ship to be a glutton for an entire year. Knowing that, Ms. Maringal, do you know how hard it is to catch a Reader?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll tell me.&#8221; Lina hoped that the man didn&#8217;t hear the quiver in her voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Not particularly hard. Disable their sails, find them drunk in a tavern; at the end of the day, Readers are just men who happen to be good at directions. Windseers, on the other hand&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina didn&#8217;t like where he was going with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Windseers are wily. Always seem to know when you&#8217;re coming up behind them. You fire at their ship, and they just happen to turn before your cannons blow. Would you like to know how many cannonballs I wasted on the <em>Queen Marie</em>?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina&#8217;s stomach dropped. How could he have known? She had been so careful about concealing her abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locke laughed. &#8220;There are currently 158 men serving aboard the <em>Crown of Gold</em> yet the bounty on bringing in a Windseer can still set me and my crew up for quite a long time&#8230; but the look on a captain&#8217;s face when they&#8217;ve been found out is really why I do this. There are always rumors surrounding an ability so rare, but isn&#8217;t it exciting to confirm them, my friends?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ruffians behind Locke made sounds of genuine appreciation. Lina&#8217;s own crew stayed silent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina heard footsteps coming from behind, and despite herself, she broke eye contact with Locke to turn around. The sharp-nosed woman was approaching holding a large tome of a book: the ship&#8217;s manifest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ms. Ibon,&#8221; Locke said, taking the book. He didn&#8217;t bother to open it, seemingly content to tap his finger on the cover for several heartbeats. &#8220;I have a proposition, Ms. Maringal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8216;captain&#8217;, and I&#8217;m not interested.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not just for you, but for the entire crew of this ship.&#8221; Locke turned and raised his voice. &#8220;I would like to make an offer to the Windseer aboard this ship to join the Commonwealth navy. You know how rare you are, so you know how well you&#8217;ll be paid. As an added bonus, if you come with us, we&#8217;ll leave the rest of the crew and the entirety of your cargo untouched.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina&#8217;s jaw tightened, but she didn&#8217;t respond. Unsurprisingly, the rest of her crew stayed silent as well as there wasn&#8217;t another soul who could claim to be a Reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locke sighed dramatically. &#8220;No one? Well, our writ also explicitly tells me to detain any Readers I find, so I am legally allowed‚Äîreally, obliged‚Äîto find the Windseer on this ship and take them, even if it means killing the lot of you.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This caused a murmur. Damn him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But! If any of you would kindly just tell me who the Windseer is, you&#8217;ll all get the same offer: me and mine just walk away with just a single member of this ship, and you all are free to continue on with whatever distasteful business you were on.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina spoke through gritted teeth, staring down Locke with restrained fury. &#8220;We. Have. No. Wind‚Äî&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina blinked and broke her gaze from Locke, head darting toward whoever had spoken. She found Cedro&#8217;s outstretched finger, though his eyes were pointed at the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sorry, ma&#8217;am. Our lives aren&#8217;t worth it.&#8221; Cedro turned to look at Locke. &#8220;Captain Locke, Captain Maringal is our Windseer. We don&#8217;t want any more trouble. We&#8217;ve given you what you want, so leave us in peace. We&#8217;ve dead to put to rest and repairs to make.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Cedro&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Think of the crew, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina began to lunge at Cedro, but almost as soon as she moved, the sharp-nosed woman had her arm painfully twisted behind her back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you, my good friend.&#8221; Locke jerked Lina&#8217;s arm downward and grabbed her other. She felt manacles bite around her wrists. &#8220;Well, I believe our business is concluded and we&#8217;ll be off. Until next time, my friends.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locke gave a mock salute then shoved Lina toward gangplank. She struggled against his push only for someone to knock her in the back of the head with the butt of a rifle. Pain flashed through Lina&#8217;s vision like canonfire. Her body slumped, and more arms came to drag her onto the <em>Crown of Gold</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Lina&#8217;s vision faded, she let her eyes droop shut and her senses expand. The sudden sensory overload‚Äîthe musty smell of wood and sweat, the damp chill of the evening mists, the strong taste of salt‚Äîof the world around her was like a shock to her system, and she managed to regain some of her composure with a shudder. Lina took another breath and noticed something else. No&#8230; someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the darkness below the lantern light but above the waterline, someone crawled out one of the <em>Queen Marie&#8217;s</em> portholes and silently jumped onto the <em>Crown of Gold&#8217;s</em> hull, slipping into one of the ship&#8217;s open gun ports. Lina did not recognize their smell as someone from her own ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The privateers were not particularly gentle when they dropped Lina on the <em>Crown of Gold&#8217;s</em> deck. With her arms behind her back, Lina had to awkwardly contort her body so she wouldn&#8217;t hit the sea-soaked wood face first. She landed on her shoulder with a heavy thud, then with some effort, rolled onto her side so she could see the rest of the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lina did not have use her Sight to feel the that the <em>Crown of Gold</em> had unhooked herself from the <em>Queen Marie</em> and began drifting away. The wind did tell her that someone unusually quiet was coming up from below deck. As predicted, a figure came up a ladder onto the deck. He‚Äîat least Lina thought it was a man, though his lithe frame made it hard to tell‚Äîwas dressed in all black, loose fabric around his limbs. He doffed his hood and face cloth, revealing high cheekbones and pale skin. His eyes betrayed nothing, but with her Sight and him standing only feet away, Lina could sense that his clothes reeked of charcoal, sulfur, and saltpeter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lord Apollon,&#8221; Locke said, his grin wide and toothy, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll like our haul.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man, Lord Apollon, simply nodded. The <em>Crown of Gold</em> continued to drift away from Lina‚Äôs&nbsp; home and charge, and as the wind shifted again, Lina thought she heard a hiss on the breeze. <em>No</em>. Lina felt a telltale flicker of heat at the back of her neck coming from the <em>Queen Marie&#8217;s </em>direction followed by a roar of flame deafened the heavens.</p>\n","date":"November 1st, 2017","tags":[{"name":"dagat","slug":"dagat"},{"name":"nanowrimo","slug":"nanowrimo"},{"name":"windseer","slug":"windseer"}]},{"title":"So Comes the&nbsp;Rain","slug":"so-comes-the-rain","excerpt":"<p>[WP] Something unusual is raining from the skies.

She adjusted a dirty rag in her dirtier hands and started working the bolt carrier&#8217;s other side. Twenty five days in this hellhole. Twenty five days listening to moans of the dying get louder.Twenty five days too scared to light a candle after an unfamiliar sun set. Twenty five fucking days waiting for the cavalry that was supposed to be here in two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A muffled explosion rattled through the abandoned office&#8217;s walls. Cypress stopped cleaning and focused on her hearing. Above the sniffling of refugees around her, she heard another explosion, smaller this time, followed by a rattle of gunfire. Not alarmingly close, but not too far, either. Cypress hurriedly shoved the bolt carrier back into place and put her gun back together. Her hands were shaking again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lietenant!&#8221; a hoarse voice shouted. Cypress turned her head as she twisted the last pin into place. &#8220;We need all guns to the north! Now!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221; Cypress responded. Her heart was racing. They had just moved yesterday! How had the worms figured out their new position so quickly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cypress scrambled to her feet and ran toward the northern wall, knuckles white while clenching her rifle. In moments, she was pressed up against an exterior facing wall, eyes stealing glances outside the window like the other dozen soldiers around her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Movement. Cypress raised her rifle to point at a humanoid shambling down the street, but it flopped to the ground after a resounding crack from someone else&#8217;s shot. Cypress was quietly thankful for the night; in the darkness, she couldn&#8217;t see the worms wriggling away from its dying, human host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several more hosts emerged, and the soldiers took them down with veteran efficiency. After a minute, other than the bodies, the street was clear once more. Everyone kept their guns out for several more minutes before breathing a sigh of relief. Just a scout party. They&#8217;d have to move, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as Cypress lowered her rifle, she heard a low rumble in the distance. The other soldiers started to notice as the thunder rose in volume. Then it stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blood curdling scream pierced the night air, then the sound of hundreds of footsteps came again. Moments after, a crowd, no, a&nbsp;<em>sea</em>&nbsp;of humanoids surged from around the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cypress started firing immediately, as did everyone else. The bodies piled up, but the obstacles did little to slow the worms. Cypress released her spent magazine and slammed a new one inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worms broke upon the lower floor like a wave crashing on the shore. The door was barricaded, but who knew how long that would hold&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Fire Team Omega, do you read me?&#8221;</em>&nbsp;came a voice from Cypress&#8217; radio through static.&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Fire Team Omega, do you read me? This is the SSV Everest. Over.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cypress grabbed the radio and hit a button. &#8220;SSV Everest, Fire Team Omega reads you. We&#8217;re pinned down! Where are you?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Straight overhead. We see the worms. Beginning deployment.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cypress just dropped the radio and started firing into the crowd again. Suddenly, something in the night sky flared. She looked up to see a flaming shape emerge from the thick clouds and slam into the ground. The first pod was followed by hundreds more, all raining onto the city. Drop pods, with fresh troops and more guns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s finally raining, men.

From here, goods are shipped either by garagen train to the capital or down the Great Genavais River to the Alengyr Sea. Other goods are brought in by garagen train or river from the Alengyr and are then shipped up the Genavais and Calmor further inland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city was originally known as Genevais City, but was appointed the first Patriarch Irinio 500 years ago. 300 years ago, all direct descendants of the Irinio line died in the Second Giant War, thus elevating the first Matriarch Irinio and officially changing the city&#8217;s name from Irinio-Se to Irinios-Ma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Points of Interest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A. Irinio Grand Keep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The royal family lives here. Current ruler is Matriarch Prima Irinio. At the center of the keep is a small natural aquasphere. While not of much practical use due to the surrounding rivers, the giants created a place of worship around it several hundred years ago. The third Matriarch Irinio tore down the old temple (some say out of spite) and constructed the keep around it. The keep features tasteful waterfalls and hanging gardens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B. Genavais Bridge</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Genavais Bridge was first constructed as a wall during the reign of the giants to stop Alengyr raiders from rowing further up river than the fort could defend. The wall was sturdy enough to be converted to a bridge after the fact. The bridge was later modified to allow akaramancers to rotate a portion of it to allow ships to pass through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C. First Fort</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the old Genavais city is the First Fort, which is also the main headquarters of the royal guard. It was built before giants came but was augmented during their reign using human labor. Today&#8217;s soaring towers and cavernous halls are the fort&#8217;s hallmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D. Genavais Lighthouse</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giants were not ship builders, so the lighthouse was not built until after the city was taken over by humans. It is perhaps the second oldest building in the city. A blazing fire is lit after sunsdown every day as akaram lamps do not shine as brightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>E. Calmor Bridge</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Calmor Bridge was built after the city&#8217;s expansion northward. It is tall enough to allow small ships underneath, though the arches are chained to corral unwanted traffic. Train tracks from the garagen station are set into the stone itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>F. Bella Arena</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tower/skull arena was originally located in the west where the city had its second planned expansion. Patriarch Vicente Bella gave the Irinios a new arena in the city&#8217;s newest sector as a wedding present for the former Matriarch Vesta Irinio and his younger brother, Nicollante.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>G. Shields of the Falling Sky Keep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shields of the Falling Sky have a major outpost and observatory in the city situated in a darker corner of the city&#8217;s third expansion. They maintain a watchful eye on the heavens for any heldyn attacks in the greater area around the city. This is also a major stop for the Roaming Shields which keep watch over the Genavais farmland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>H. Naso Garagen Station</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garagen are bred and raised outside the city but are housed here. Currently, the trains only run to the capital. While the linkages were planned to Mara-Ma and the central Marten-Se hub, all progress was halted during the Great Hydorian Civil War.</p>\n","date":"January 26th, 2016","tags":[{"name":"aleta","slug":"aleta"},{"name":"cities","slug":"cities"},{"name":"lore","slug":"lore"},{"name":"matriarch","slug":"matriarch"}]},{"title":"Matriarch: Chapter 1","slug":"matriarch-chapter-1","excerpt":"<p>The two suns of Aleta hung close together in a cloudless summer sky as a band of thirty marched down a broken cobblestone road.

The regular crunch of boots on loose stone and scraping of rings on plates mixed with the pattering hoof beats of the ten riders traveling alongside the party. Spears pointed from their ranks to the empty sky. A single bird sang somewhere nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two women rode ahead of the column, and unlike the other horse riders, sat atop broad shouldered trihorn. Their mounts had their three horns shaped in the curled fashion of war beasts, not the splayed twisting forms used in shows, and the women wore polished steel rather than dyed cotton. Matriarch Vesta Irinio and her eldest daughter, Priya, were on the hunt, not out for pleasure. Raiders from the Alengyr Sea had sailed upriver and were attacking merchants and villages, and it was the Irinio family&#8217;s duty to protect their reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya awkwardly transferred her family&#8217;s banner from her right hand to her left, managing to keep her balance while raising the banner&#8217;s shaft over and around her mount&#8217;s thick neck. She cradled the standard as she was taught to make the weight more bearable. Her mother had told her that her soldiers would not respect a leader who wouldn&#8217;t carry their own crest. As such, Priya held the red falcon above her head with pride‚Äîand without complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They heard galloping around the bend before they saw the horsemen. Priya tensed as a rank of soldiers surged forward around herself and her mother, setting their pavises down and drawing crossbows. A second line of soldiers stood behind the bows and lowered spears between the shields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two armed and armored men rounded the bend. They flew no banner, but Priya recognized her elder brother easily enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Stand down,&#8221; Matriarch Irinio commanded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her soldiers raised their spears and lowered their crossbows as the two men approached. The riders slowed their galloping horses to a canter then a trot, the beasts breathing heavily and braying restlessly from what must have been a hard ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Devo, Garland,&#8221; the matriarch said to her son and to the captain of the guard, respectively. &#8220;Have you found anything?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both men took their helmets off. Devo&#8217;s black curls fell wetly across his forehead as he quickly bowed his head once to the current matriarch and once more to the future matriarch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We saw smoke rising from the forest half a mile down and went in to investigate. It&#8217;s the raiders, mother. A camp of about 50&#8211;more than we thought.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t see you, yes?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Aye. They have scouts watching the roads, but I reckon they&#8217;re more concerned with the next caravan, not a couple scouts,&#8221; Garland Hoss replied. &#8220;We were able to slip past to take a look at the camp. As far as we know, there was no alarm raised.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221; The matriarch turned to her daughter. &#8220;Priya, assuming the element of surprise and 50 deserters and mercenaries, what course of action would you take?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya was not surprised by the question. She was 16 now; more than old enough to take over for Mother when the time came. This was not her first hunt, nor was this the first lesson Mother had taught her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I need more information.&#8221; Priya turned to her brother. &#8220;Devo, did you see how active the camp was? What kind of weapons and armor?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Boiled leather, steel helms, and old pikes, mostly. We could see only five horses.&#8221; Devo paused. &#8220;I could smell meat so I think they were eating the rest. The raiders are awake, but half were still tending to their breakfasts rather than their armor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya thought for a moment. &#8220;We should either attack now before they are prepared, or we need to go back then return with more soldiers.&#8221; Priya glanced at her mother. The matriarch continued to stare expectantly at her daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Priya continued, &#8220;if we turn back now, we may lose the raiders again until they&#8217;ve seized yet another caravan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The matriarch gave the faintest of nods. &#8220;Good. You have command, now.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya resisted the urge to look over her shoulder at the men and women behind her. She did that exactly once before. The soldiers had the same looks of expectation, but they were waiting for orders, not answers. The former weighed heavier on Priya than the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya looked at the trees instead. Equal training, better arms, but fewer hands. But with more horses&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Priya turned her crossbow upside down and hooked the steel cord on her trihorn&#8217;s topmost horn. She leaned her full weight, stirrup and all, into the weapon until she felt the cord lock into firing position. She frowned at the dead man ten yards ahead. A shaft of wood protruded from his back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya wondered if the man had a wife or children, or if he had a mother and father in some town somewhere. The thoughts were brief. The girl pushed them from her mind as she loaded another bolt. By law, they had given the criminal a chance to surrender. The dead man had abandoned his family when he came to these woods and abandoned them once again when he refused to put down his pike and tried to shout a warning. Priya had made sure he couldn&#8217;t cry out a second time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once finished with her weapon, Priya pulled her house&#8217;s banner from the ground and held it high once more. Flanked by the matriarch and the captain, the girl kicked her trihorn forward through the woods again. Thirty foot soldiers marched wordlessly behind the trio, heavy boots crunching over dead leaves and broken twigs. It didn&#8217;t take long for them to start smelling smoke and meat. Sooner still, they heard shouting and metal banging on metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The troop came upon the outlaw camp in a small clearing. A large pavilion stood in the center surrounded by several smaller tents. Fires still burned and pots threatened to spill over from heat. This was no longer the brigands&#8217; main concern. Half the camp had barely managed to get their helmets on&#8211;at most, a handful had unsecured leather cuirasses over their bodies. A few opportunistic men and women had forgone their armor altogether and started off deeper into the woods with what treasures they could carry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;HALT!&#8221; Priya shouted. She planted the Irinio standard into the ground and pulled out her crossbow. Half the camp did as told while the rest kept outfitting themselves. Priya raised a hand and gestured forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rank of soldiers stepped forward and around the three riders and set down pavises. They pulled out crossbows. This seemed to draw the rest of the camp&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Do not make&#8211;&#8221; the words caught in Priya&#8217;s mouth. Her mother glared at her. A matriarch was never forced into actions by someone other than herself. Priya swallowed and spoke again. &#8220;I will not repeat myself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the raiders, who had managed to strap his cuirass on as well as drape mail over his shoulders looked at Priya and pointed his pike at her. &#8220;And who are you to ask us anything with less men than us?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya glared at the man then waved her crossbow at her family&#8217;s banner. &#8220;Are you blind or just stupid? I&#8211;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Priya.&#8221; The matriarch didn&#8217;t shout, but the tone of disappointment was enough to make Priya flinch. Matriarch Irinio turned to the brigand. &#8220;What my daughter, <em>Matron</em> Priya <em>Irinio</em>, no doubt meant to say was that you‚Äîand your camp‚Äîare lifting weapons against the Irinio family and our royal guard. In addition, we see that you are in possession of several wagons with sigils of law abiding merchants and villagers of the reach‚Äîwagons that have been claimed stolen with deadly force by said parties. Both offenses, by decree of His Grand Majesty, Emperor Galanakis Byroed Hydor, third of his name, are punishable by death. Lay down your arms and we will consider granting mercy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya felt like like a flower past midsummer, wilting with the heat of each word, but at least her mother&#8217;s speech had gotten every brigand&#8217;s eyes fixed on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man on the ground momentarily dropped the point of his pike then gritted his teeth and raised the weapon again. Priya could see him mouthing a prayer or a curse through his unkempt beard. &#8220;Well, m&#8217;ladies, while getting eaten by heldyn seems like a <em>mercy</em> we&#8217;d all like partake in, it looks to me that a better thing to do with our time is to let the matriarch and her daughter walk away alive.&#8221; There were some mutterings of approval behind the man. &#8220;And while we&#8217;ve been talking, the boys and girls have all sobered up and are starting to itch for some royal blood.&#8221; More cheers this time. &#8220;Now looking around, it seems to me that we got twice the spears and twice the riders. And I think Vilirius is starting to wake up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five riders rode up behind the man. Then, as if on cue, both flaps of the pavilion were pushed aside as a fourteen foot tall giant stepped out. Mail hung over his gaunt torso, but his trunk-like legs were covered in rusted plate which seemed to have been stitched together from various bits of scrap. The giant carried a dead tree in its thin arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya&#8217;s heart beat harder. How did Devo and Garland miss this? Retreat then coming back with more soldiers was starting to sound like the better option&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So you do not surrender?&#8221; The matriarch&#8217;s words caught Priya by surprise, flinching her out of her thoughts. The matriarch was walking her trihorn forward. She was taking command again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brigands all chuckled, including a deep rumbling chortle from the giant. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d ask you what your daughter asked me, but I think that would be rude, <em>my lady</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; The matriarch took out her crossbow and unceremoniously shot the brigand in the gut. There was supposed to be a hand signal to fire, but this was obviously the same message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya raised her crossbow and shot at one of the enemy riders as planned. Her bolt, and the bolts of her soldiers, struck two of the outlaws down and dehorsed a third. Priya was reloading when she heard someone on the other side yell &#8220;charge!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Form up!&#8221; yelled Matriarch Irinio. Spears and shields obeyed and stepped up and around the matriarch. The mass of outlaws slowed at the pointed spears but then brought their own longer pikes to bear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya let out one more shot without bothering to see if it hit then picked up the Irinio banner and waved it side to side. She saw movement at the far end of the clearing. A small group of charging horses erupted from the trees, though their stampede made no sound. At the head of the charge was Devo holding a burning scroll. He let the wind take it so he could pull out his sabre. As the scroll fluttered away, the nine horses&#8217; thundering hooves could suddenly be heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the outlaws turned, confused, only to be struck from behind. Panic crawled through their ranks, and before they could gather themselves, Matriarch Irinio shouted, &#8220;Forward!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The matriarch opened her mouth to issue another command, but it was lost as a man dressed in Irinio red flew across the battlefield, launched by the giant. The right flank of spearmen were just trying to keep the giant occupied; they couldn&#8217;t get close enough to attack any gaps in its armor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Priya, Garland, take care of the giant.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, Matriarch,&#8221; they said as one. Priya planted the standard back down and loaded another bolt. Garland raised his spear and the two wheeled around toward the giant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the sea of fighting, Priya could see Devo bringing the cavalry in and out of the enemy flanks, hammering at their edges while the infantry pressed on. The last two enemy riders were nowhere to be seen, but three of Devo&#8217;s were missing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya took her eyes off the main battle and focused on the giant. Vilirius. A common enough name for a giant, but more importantly, a name that Priya didn&#8217;t associate with any particularly notable accomplishments. However, he was still giant, even if he was unheralded. The Hydorian empire was founded by giants, and humans had only taken the empire using the power of akaramancy. While Devo had used a scroll earlier to silence the cavalry&#8217;s approach, he was no trained akarmanacer&#8211;nor was anyone else in the troop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would have to make do. Priya raised her crossbow and aimed it at the giant&#8217;s head. She remembered words from her bowmaster about aiming on a galloping mount and pointed her weapon lower. She squeezed the trigger and felt her weapon shudder as it released its built up tension into the loaded bolt. The steel tipped projectile flew threw the air and pierced Vilirius&#8217; mail shirt, puncturing the giant&#8217;s chest. Judging from the reaction‚Äîmore anger than hurt‚Äîthe bolt didn&#8217;t puncture either of the giant&#8217;s hearts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Priya wheeled her trihorn out of Vilirius&#8217; reach, Garland galloped by and threw his spear. The weapon struck deep into the giant&#8217;s belly, and as response, the giant slammed the ground where Garland had been not a second before, bellowing with rage. The giant grabbed the spear and wrenched it from his gut then threw it to the ground. Thick red blood dripped from the wound, but otherwise the giant didn&#8217;t slow down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the foot soldiers, taking cue from her captain, hurled her spear before Priya could stop her. The spear was able to break rings and draw blood, but without the added speed of a mount, it could not pierce the giant&#8217;s thick skin. The giant responded by batting the soldier away like a cat playing with yarn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya kicked her trihorn for another charge and let fly another bolt. it struck the giant in the chest near the first bolt. This time, however, blood poured out of the wound rather than merely dripping. Vilirius coughed and spat crimson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya gave a triumphant shout as she wheeled her trihorn around. That was definitely a heart shot. Now they only had to wait until the second heart failed to‚Äî</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Priya&#8217;s thoughts were interrupted by a sickening crunch and sideways lurch. The girl and her trihorn hit the ground hard, and a second series of cracks sounded as the beast fell on top of the girl&#8217;s leg. Priya cried in pain and desperately tried to pull herself free from the trihorn. The beast had already gone into shock and wouldn&#8217;t move. Priya suddenly found her helmet too stifling and tore it off. She tried to push herself out again, but every shove resulted in more unbearable pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The girl&#8217;s head was starting to feel fuzzier and lighter. She looked skyward and noticed a large shape block out the twin suns. It raised something over its head. Priya felt the ground rumble somewhere else. Everything went black.</p>\n","date":"January 10th, 2016","tags":[{"name":"aleta","slug":"aleta"},{"name":"matriarch","slug":"matriarch"}]},{"title":"Lore: Pelantesque Keep","slug":"lore-pelantesque-keep","excerpt":"<p>Originally known as Gyrwelich City, Pelantesque-Ma has been a major trade hub situated on the outlet of the Great Gyrwelich Lake for the past few hundred years due to being at the halfway point of the largest river connecting the Gyrwol Mountains to the Alengyr Sea.

A chill breeze blew across the mountain&#8217;s bare rock. Besides the wind and a young man&#8217;s footsteps, nothing stirred. The evening insects had gone silent, and the morning birds didn&#8217;t dare fly in the territory of an iron dragon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus, on the other hand, paced nervously in this silence. He had tracked the dragon to these cliffs the day before, and he had snuck to his current vantage point above the creature&#8217;s nest during the night while it hunted. He pulled his cloak around himself to fight the early spring air, but loosened it only a moment later as he felt himself sweat. It seemed like a good time to pee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before he could contemplate emptying his bladder, his ears picked up a distant rumbling. Relief that his wait was finally over was quickly replaced with anxiety over the same reason. Marcus dropped to the ground and let his cloak fall around himself. His heart raced as the dragon&#8217;s whirring propellers grew louder. From previous hunts with his clan, he knew his cloak would keep him hidden from the iron dragon&#8217;s eyes, but logic rarely quieted emotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an old one, on its last legs, Marcus told himself. It was the only beast he&#8217;d seen in the past few days besides his horse, but even his poor girl had run out of fuel a day ago. THis is why he was here: dragon&#8217;s blood. Even a rusted over, hole-filled dragon would have enough left in the tank to get him across the wastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whirring crescendo suddenly became a roar as the dragon crested a snow capped peak. Marcus watched it fly low over the mountains, its gigantic wings held straight out to keep it aloft. It approached the valley and began circling in descent. Marcus could almost feel the spinning engines vibrating in his bones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iron beast had to take wide circles to lower itself, with part of the arc passing underneath Marcus&#8217; perch. He had to time this perfectly. First, he had to jump such that the dragon would catch his fall. That was the easy part. Second, Marcus had to judge how high he wanted to the dragon to be. His heart raced faster. Too low and he would break something landing on the metal exoskeleton. Too high, and he wouldn&#8217;t have a chance of surviving the crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each lazy circle brought the dragon closer to the ground. Beads of sweat formed on Marcus&#8217; brow. This was insane. Hunts always happened with at least two people. One would distract and lead the dragon on predictable paths while the other could use a glider to have some measure of control. Without a living friend, Marcus had to rely on surprise. The chances weren&#8217;t good, but still, they were marginally higher than surviving in the wastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus&#8217; eyes narrowed. The dragon was circling close to the cliff face for the fifth time. This was it. He slowly brought himself off his belly and into a crouch, carefully watching for any deviation in his target&#8217;s path. He gripped his spear tightly, knuckles turning white with anticipation. Then he jumped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus&#8217; cloak flailed around him, but the hunger managed to keep his eyes focused on his quarry. His stomach turned, and the initial rush of the fall was immediately replaced with adrenaline fueled clarity. Marcus thrust his spear down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was the not yet familiar crunch and screech of tearing metal as the hunter&#8217;s spear coroded and pierced the dragon&#8217;s head. Marcus landed hard. He would feel that tomorrow, but the dragon had the worst of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creature&#8217;s engines roared into higher gear, and it began swerving to throw the hunter off. Marcus held onto the spear for dear life. The beast had been rusted before, but corrosion spread like a blight from the impact point. All Marcus had to do was maintain his grip long enough for the poison to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seconds felt like hours as the beast bucked and banked. But soon, the engines stopped roaring and quieted to a purr of defeat. The left side failed, then the right. The two bodies began accelerating toward the ground.<br>Marcus braced himself but didn&#8217;t dare close his eyes. The dragon&#8217;s wings kept them in a steep dive rather than a free fall, but the ground was still approaching entirely too fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then metal met stone, sending showers of dirt and gravel into the air. Marcus managed to hold his spear for only a few moments before being violently thrown off. He screamed as he hit the ground shoulder first, but his voice was drowned out by the thundering crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost as quickly as it had begun, silence returned to the valley. Marcus blinked tears out of his eyes, and as the dust settled, he saw the dragon broken in two, though its precious silver blood was only trickling out. Marcus untied a leather skin from his waist, took a few breaths, and began his work. He&#8217;d be out of here soon.</p>\n","date":"August 26th, 2015","tags":[{"name":"writing prompt","slug":"writing-prompt"}]},{"title":"Cape of Gilgamesh","slug":"cape-of-gilgamesh","excerpt":"<p>[WP] All superpowers come from capes.

The bigger the cape, the stronger the superpower</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron stat with her eyes closed and legs crossed, meditating in silence in the stone chambers. Sunlight poured through the open windows, illuminating her brilliant white cape which fluttered and flowed around her despite the lack of wind. Her cape was more than mere fabric; it was an extension of her soul, and as she mediated, more white threads coalesced from thin air and wove themselves into the edges of her power. The meditation chamber was normally spacious, but Heron&#8217;s cape had already flowed over the whole floor. It was starting to weave yet another layer upward when the sunlight suddenly turned to shadow and a sound like dynamite disturbed the peace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Heron!&#8221; a booming voice called. Heron could hear the voice both with her ears and projected directly into her mind. She ignored the voice, her regular breathing not skipping a beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is I, Gilgamesh, the Hero of Heroes!&#8221; He must have been unaware that most everyone called him Gilgamesh the Devourer. &#8220;Come out of that hut you call a fortress and join me in the glorious sky such that we may talk!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron continued to not move. A single thread, about to join the rest, instead wiggled back into the air and burned slowly. The faintest whisper, &#8220;no&#8221; drifted into Gilgamesh&#8217;s surface thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A moment later, the ground rumbled, and Heron could feel Gilgamesh&#8217;s anger project through her entire body. Dust shook itself loose and swirled into the air as the quake grew stronger. There was a deafening crack accompanied by a shower of gravel and timber. Only then did Heron open her eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She looked up to see the entire top half of her tower flying off into the distance. Instead of blue, a writhing, shifting canvas of gold colored the sky. A large section of it was burning away, and for a brief moment the sun was visible, but the hole quickly mended once the earth stopped shaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That was a command, not a request!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s talk,&#8221; Heron said. She sighed and got to her feet. As soon as she did, she was caught off guard by a crushing force on her back and sholders, pushing her to her knees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Gilgamesh voice reverberated in her mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron briefly saw another patch of gold burn before Gilgamesh forced her head to the ground. She only just caught herself before the man could give her a concussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I thought you might be different from the other Capes. The gods themselves said i am the greatest. Are you like the others and you cannot hear them sing my praise even now? Can you not comprehend the sky of gold I have woven together to fulfill my destiny? It is obvious that the gods have chosen ME as a vessel to reincarnate the King of Kings. I come to your remote island to offer you the privilege of weaving your soul into mine, to harness your full potential to bring justice and unity to the world instead of just your puny Arachnine City. In the face of such opportunity, you refuse to even see me as a guest when I come to your remote island?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron laughed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And now you mock me? Or is this just an insect coping wit htheir imminent destruction?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No, you were right the first time. It is mockery. There are no gods. You&#8217;re just insane.&#8221; As Heron spoke, her cape, previously pressed to the ground like its wearer, began to float again. The white fabric rolled and folded in on itself. Some of it wrapped around Heron&#8217;s body, and the rest twirled into three pillars that pushed the woman back to her feet. The body might have been too weak to resist the force of Gilgamesh&#8217;s soul, but another soul? Child&#8217;s play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron continued pushing and growing her new legs, raising herself toward the human shaped speck floating in the shifting gold sky. She could see now that Gilgamesh&#8217;s cape was easily ten times the size of her own. Despite the fact that he was no longer pushing down on Heron, his cape still burned at the edges. It seemed that he was using his power to keep himself in the sky without support. A cape was just an extension of oneself, and like forming a fist, required only a thought to shape. Reshaping the world outside the body, however, required a sacrifice. Gilgamesh must have believed he had enough power to spare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can see why you didn&#8217;t want to come out. You&#8217;re just an old woman, too frail to fly. The stories said you saved the city from thousands of unbound threads. I can barely believe you fought ten.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gilgamesh brought his arms up and at least a dozen patches of his cape flared. The ground erupted in an equal number of places, earth and stone flying into the air and swirling together to form massive spikes before hurtling toward Heron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heron simply moved out of the way as each approached. It wasn&#8217;t a serious attack; it was a show of force and power. Most Capes struggled to control five things at the same time, and those who could often rarely had enough fabric to burn. Gilgamesh wanted to make it clear that he had both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lithium also moved too much,&#8221; Gilgamesh laughed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And you simply talk too much.&#8221; Heron scowled. Lithium had been somewhat of a protege several years ago. Heron was now close enough to Gilgamesh to make out the seams in his cape where other lengths of fabric had been sloppily patched in. Though its brilliant blues had been dyed gold by Gilgamesh&#8217;s power, one patch clearly had the embroidery of Lithium&#8217;s cape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gilgamesh laughed even harder and flared his cape in a hundred different places.</p>\n","date":"August 22nd, 2015","tags":[{"name":"writing prompt","slug":"writing-prompt"}]},{"title":"Aleta World Map","slug":"aleta-world-map","excerpt":"<p>This is a map of the entire known world of Aleta.

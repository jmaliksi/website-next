Ore, quarried stone, and akaram stone come down the Calmor from the Cawol mountains (not to scale), and crops come down the Genavais River from the fertile lands around it. From here, goods are shipped either by garagen train to the capital or down the Great Genavais River to the Alengyr Sea. Other goods are brought in by garagen train or river from the Alengyr and are then shipped up the Genavais and Calmor further inland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city was originally known as Genevais City, but was appointed the first Patriarch Irinio 500 years ago. 300 years ago, all direct descendants of the Irinio line died in the Second Giant War, thus elevating the first Matriarch Irinio and officially changing the city&#8217;s name from Irinio-Se to Irinios-Ma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Points of Interest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A. Irinio Grand Keep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The royal family lives here. Current ruler is Matriarch Prima Irinio. At the center of the keep is a small natural aquasphere. While not of much practical use due to the surrounding rivers, the giants created a place of worship around it several hundred years ago. The third Matriarch Irinio tore down the old temple (some say out of spite) and constructed the keep around it. The keep features tasteful waterfalls and hanging gardens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B. Genavais Bridge</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Genavais Bridge was first constructed as a wall during the reign of the giants to stop Alengyr raiders from rowing further up river than the fort could defend. The wall was sturdy enough to be converted to a bridge after the fact. The bridge was later modified to allow akaramancers to rotate a portion of it to allow ships to pass through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C. First Fort</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the old Genavais city is the First Fort, which is also the main headquarters of the royal guard. It was built before giants came but was augmented during their reign using human labor. Today&#8217;s soaring towers and cavernous halls are the fort&#8217;s hallmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D. Genavais Lighthouse</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giants were not ship builders, so the lighthouse was not built until after the city was taken over by humans. It is perhaps the second oldest building in the city. A blazing fire is lit after sunsdown every day as akaram lamps do not shine as brightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>E. Calmor Bridge</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Calmor Bridge was built after the city&#8217;s expansion northward. It is tall enough to allow small ships underneath, though the arches are chained to corral unwanted traffic. Train tracks from the garagen station are set into the stone itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>F. Bella Arena</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tower/skull arena was originally located in the west where the city had its second planned expansion. Patriarch Vicente Bella gave the Irinios a new arena in the city&#8217;s newest sector as a wedding present for the former Matriarch Vesta Irinio and his younger brother, Nicollante.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>G. Shields of the Falling Sky Keep</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shields of the Falling Sky have a major outpost and observatory in the city situated in a darker corner of the city&#8217;s third expansion. They maintain a watchful eye on the heavens for any heldyn attacks in the greater area around the city. This is also a major stop for the Roaming Shields which keep watch over the Genavais farmland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>H. Naso Garagen Station</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garagen are bred and raised outside the city but are housed here. Currently, the trains only run to the capital. While the linkages were planned to Mara-Ma and the central Marten-Se hub, all progress was halted during the Great Hydorian Civil War.</p>\n","date":"January 26th, 2016","tags":[{"name":"aleta","slug":"aleta"},{"name":"cities","slug":"cities"},{"name":"lore","slug":"lore"},{"name":"matriarch","slug":"matriarch"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cities","tagName":"cities"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4113534866"]}
